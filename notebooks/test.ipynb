       "\n",
       "**Overview:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Mosquito bites are a common nuisance, especially during warmer months. \n",
       "* While mostly harmless, they can cause itchy welts and, in some cases, transmit serious diseases. \n",
       "* Understanding mosquito habits and bite prevention is crucial for protecting public health. \n",
       "* According to the World Health Organization, mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, and Zika virus, \n",
       "cause millions of deaths worldwide each year.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Facts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Global Impact:** Mosquitoes are responsible for more human deaths than any other animal on earth.\n",
       "* **Prevalence:** Mosquito bites are extremely common, with billions of people experiencing them annually.\n",
       "* **Disease Transmission:**  Mosquitoes act as vectors, spreading diseases like West Nile Virus, Zika Virus, Dengue\n",
       "Fever, and Malaria.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Symptoms:** \n",
       "\n",
       "* **Common:**\n",
       "    * Itchiness\n",
       "    * Redness\n",
       "    * Swelling at the bite site\n",
       "* **Less Common <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">(</span>Potential Allergic Reaction<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">)</span>:**\n",
       "    * Large area of swelling\n",
       "    * Low-grade fever\n",
       "    * Hives\n",
       "    * Swollen lymph nodes\n",
       "\n",
       "**Types:** \n",
       "\n",
       "While there are thousands of mosquito species, not all bite humans. Those that do typically fall into these \n",
       "categories:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Aedes:** Transmitters of Zika, Dengue, and Yellow Fever.\n",
       "* **Anopheles:**  Primary vectors for Malaria.\n",
       "* **Culex:** Can transmit West Nile Virus and other diseases.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Causes:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Feeding:** Female mosquitoes require blood meals for egg production. \n",
       "* **Saliva:** During feeding, mosquitoes inject saliva containing anticoagulants and proteins, triggering an immune\n",
       "response in humans that causes itching and swelling.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Risk Factors:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Location:** Living or traveling to areas with high mosquito populations.\n",
       "* **Time of Day:** Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk.\n",
       "* **Clothing:** Wearing dark colors or exposing skin can attract mosquitoes.\n",
       "* **Blood Type:**  Some research suggests certain blood types may be more attractive to mosquitoes.\n",
       "* **Genetics:**  Individual body chemistry can influence attractiveness to mosquitoes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Diagnosis:** \n",

Understanding which diseases, and where within their distributions, these impacts are most likely to occur is critical for preparing public health interventions. While research has centered on potential warming-driven expansions in vector transmission, less is known about the potential for vectors to experience warming-driven stress or even local extirpations. In conservation biology, species risk from climate warming is often quantified through vulnerability indices such as thermal safety margins-the difference between an organism's upper thermal limit and its habitat temperature. Here, we estimated thermal safety margins for 8 mosquito species that are the vectors of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile and other major arboviruses, across their known ranges to investigate which mosquitoes and regions are most and least vulnerable to climate warming. We find that several of the most medically important mosquito vector species, including Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae, have positive thermal safety margins across the majority of their ranges when realistic assumptions of mosquito behavioral thermoregulation are incorporated. On average, the lowest climate vulnerability, in terms of both the magnitude and duration of thermal safety, was just south of the equator and at northern temperate range edges, and the highest climate vulnerability was in the subtropics. Mosquitoes living in regions including the Middle East, the western Sahara, and southeastern Australia, which are largely comprised of desert and xeric shrubland biomes, have the highest climate vulnerability across vector species.\",\n",

Cattle have substantially higher blood-level concentrations of ivermectin compared to buffalo after receiving similar doses, irrespective of formulation.

The duration of mosquito-lethal effect of long-lasting ivermectin was superior to standard ivermectin and in cattle it well exceeded the WHO criteria for new endectocides having a mortality hazard ratio greater than 4 through 30 days after administration. Buffalo may require higher doses of long-lasting ivermectin to achieve similar mosquito-lethal effects observed in cattle. Of the four hosts evaluated buffalo were the most attractive to Anopheles followed by cattle then horse and finally humans.

       "  'abstract': 'Human mobility drives the spread of many infectious diseases, yet the health impacts of changes in mobility due to new infrastructure development are poorly understood and currently not accounted for in impact assessments. We take a novel quasi-experimental approach to identifying the link between mobility and infectious disease, leveraging historical road upgrades as a proxy for regional human mobility changes. We analyzed how highway paving altered transmission of dengue-a high-burden mosquito-borne disease-via changes in human movement in the Madre de Dios region of Peru. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway through a formerly isolated region of the Amazon in 2009 provided a unique opportunity to quantify the causal impact of road paving on disease transmission. To uncover this relationship, we compared dengue incidence data from healthcare facilities in Madre de Dios near to versus far from the newly paved highway before and after paving, while controlling for observable and unobservable confounding variables (a difference-in-differences causal inference approach). We found that the paving of the highway caused at least an additional 9,826 (95% CI: 8,562-10,684) dengue cases since paving, accounting for 45.2% (95% CI: 39.4%-49.2%) of all dengue cases recorded in the region post highway paving (2009-2022). Our findings demonstrate the impact that infrastructure can have on dengue transmission, likely via its effects on human mobility. As a result, we advocate for future road construction plans in tropical regions to account for potential increases in dengue transmission during impact assessments.',\n",

Since most fish are ectotherms, their metabolism and feeding behaviour are highly influenced by temperature. Increasing water temperatures may thus exacerbate the impact of non-native fish, particularly those adapted to warmer conditions, on prey populations. Increasing temperature can also result in divergences between the impacts of females and males, especially in sexually dimorphic species.The globally invasive tropical guppy Poecilia reticulata Peters, a popular aquarium fish also used for control of mosquito-borne diseases and as a model species in ecological and evolutionary studies, exhibits strong sexual dimorphism and larvivory. This laboratory study examined prey consumption and prey size selection by guppies fed with chironomid larvae under varying temperature conditions. The effect of sex, pregnancy and prey body size on the guppy's predatory response was also assessed by comparing Functional Responses.The results highlighted four key points: (1) increased temperature led to increased prey consumption in both females and males by decreasing handling time; (2) prey consumption was disproportionately higher in females than males, regardless of temperature; (3) temperature influenced females' prey size selection; and (4) pregnancy reduced prey handling time among females.These findings show that temperature and intraspecific differences influence the feeding response of invasive fish, and they should both be taken into account when investigating and predicting the ecological impact of invasive species on invaded food webs.\",\n",

As reservoir hosts, they are exposed to hematophagous vectors that secrete saliva, a cocktail of bioactive molecules including antigenic components stimulating host antibody production. Subsequent to the detection of mosquito-borne pathogens in macaques living in national parks, we aimed to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to crude salivary gland extracts (SGEs) from culicine mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti [Linnaeus, 1762], Ae. albopictus [Skuse, 1895] and Culex quinquefasciatus [Say, 1823]) and compare individual titres between macaque species/national parks (33, Macaca arctoides [I.

The anti-mosquito SGE antibodies found in 60 macaques from three national parks indicate varying levels of host-vector exposure. Macaque antibody titres were high against culicine mosquitoes. However, the significant difference among national parks (or macaque species) was only observed against Cx. quinquefasciatus. Correlation analysis of titres between Aedes SGE and arboviruses revealed a significantly more intense immune response against Ae. albopictus in DENV3-positive M. arctoides. Current findings support the concept of salivary biomarkers using accessible SGE, available from mosquito colonies of interest. However, we observed cross-reactivity between Aedes species because of crude SGE containing species-shared proteins. Nevertheless, a potential risk of pathogen transmission is emphasised between national park visitors and macaques via mosquitoes as bridge vectors.

Typically maintained in a sylvatic cycle between certain forest sloths, non-human primates, birds, and mosquitoes, OROV disease outbreaks can occur in an urban cycle between certain biting midges and/or mosquitoes and humans. Clinically, approximately 60% of infections are symptomatic with an abrupt fever and non-specific influenza-like illness within 3 to 10\\u2009days.

This enables rapid simulation of coalescence times in a recombining parasite population with superinfection and cotransmission, and it also provides a mathematical framework for analysis of within-host variation. Taking malaria as an example, we use this theoretical model to examine how transmission dynamics and migration affect parasite genomic diversity, including the effective recombination rate and haplotypic metrics of recent common ancestry. We show how key transmission parameters can be inferred from deep sequencing data and as a proof of concept we estimate the Plasmodium falciparum transmission bottleneck. Finally we discuss the potential applications of this novel inferential framework in genomic surveillance for malaria control and elimination.

In Victoria, Australia, BU is an endemic vector-borne zoonosis, with mosquitoes and native possums implicated in transmission, and humans incidental hosts. Despite the importance of possums as wildlife reservoirs of M. ulcerans, knowledge of BU in these animals is limited. Opportunistic necropsy-based and active trap-and-release surveillance studies were conducted across Melbourne and Geelong, Victoria, to investigate BU in possums. Demographic data and biological samples were collected, and cutaneous lesions suggestive of BU were mapped. Samples were tested for the presence of M. ulcerans DNA by IS2404 qPCR. The final dataset included 26 possums: 20 necropsied; 6 trapped and released. Most possums (77%) were common ringtails from inner Melbourne. Nine had ulcers, ranging from single and mild, to multiple and severe, exposing bones and tendons in three cases. M. ulcerans was confirmed in 73% (19/26) of examined possums: 8 with lesions and 11 without. Oral swabs were most frequently indicative of M. ulcerans infection status. Severely ulcerated possums had widespread systemic internal bacterial dissemination and were shedding M. ulcerans in faeces.

Ringtail possums appear highly susceptible to infection with M. ulcerans and are important bacterial reservoirs in Victoria.

       "  'abstract': 'The common house mosquito Culex pipiens s.l., widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and North America has two recognized biotypes, Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and Cx. pipiens biotype molestus, which hybridize. Despite their morphological similarities, these biotypes may exhibit ecological differences. This complex ecological mosaic may affect the interaction of Cx. pipiens with pathogens like avian Plasmodium, which is transmitted to wildlife. Although the vector competence for Cx. pipiens biotype molestus has been well studied, there is a lack of studies comparing the vector competence of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and their hybrids for the transmission of avian Plasmodium. Here, we evaluated the vector competence of the Cx. pipiens biotypes pipiens, molestus and their hybrids for the transmission of two avian Plasmodium species. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on blood of wild infected birds and the presence of DNA of Plasmodium in head-thorax and saliva of mosquitoes was molecularly evaluated at 13 day-post exposure. The transmission rates (i.e., the detection of parasite DNA in mosquito saliva) for Plasmodium cathemerium were similar for the two biotypes of Cx. pipiens and their hybrids while Plasmodium relictum DNA was only found in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. In addition, P. cathemerium was significantly more prevalent than P. relictum in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. Our results suggest that avian Plasmodium is transmitted by both Cx. pipiens biotypes and their hybrids although differences could be found depending of the parasite species studied. Differences in the abundance of each biotype and their hybrids within areas characterized by distinct environmental conditions, along with variations in their blood-feeding patterns and the parasites infecting birds, could ultimately determine differences in the relevance of each Cx. pipiens biotype in the transmission of avian Plasmodium.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Climate warming is expected to substantially impact the global landscape of mosquito-borne disease, but these impacts will vary across disease systems and regions. Understanding which diseases, and where within their distributions, these impacts are most likely to occur is critical for preparing public health interventions. While research has centered on potential warming-driven expansions in vector transmission, less is known about the potential for vectors to experience warming-driven stress or even local extirpations. In conservation biology, species risk from climate warming is often quantified through vulnerability indices such as thermal safety margins-the difference between an organism's upper thermal limit and its habitat temperature. Here, we estimated thermal safety margins for 8 mosquito species that are the vectors of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile and other major arboviruses, across their known ranges to investigate which mosquitoes and regions are most and least vulnerable to climate warming. We find that several of the most medically important mosquito vector species, including Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae, have positive thermal safety margins across the majority of their ranges when realistic assumptions of mosquito behavioral thermoregulation are incorporated. On average, the lowest climate vulnerability, in terms of both the magnitude and duration of thermal safety, was just south of the equator and at northern temperate range edges, and the highest climate vulnerability was in the subtropics. Mosquitoes living in regions including the Middle East, the western Sahara, and southeastern Australia, which are largely comprised of desert and xeric shrubland biomes, have the highest climate vulnerability across vector species.\",\n",

They play an essential role in the persistence of pathogens in the environment. As reservoir hosts, they are exposed to hematophagous vectors that secrete saliva, a cocktail of bioactive molecules including antigenic components stimulating host antibody production. Subsequent to the detection of mosquito-borne pathogens in macaques living in national parks, we aimed to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to crude salivary gland extracts (SGEs) from culicine mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti [Linnaeus, 1762], Ae. albopictus [Skuse, 1895] and Culex quinquefasciatus [Say, 1823]) and compare individual titres between macaque species/national parks (33, Macaca arctoides [I.

The anti-mosquito SGE antibodies found in 60 macaques from three national parks indicate varying levels of host-vector exposure. Macaque antibody titres were high against culicine mosquitoes. However, the significant difference among national parks (or macaque species) was only observed against Cx. quinquefasciatus. Correlation analysis of titres between Aedes SGE and arboviruses revealed a significantly more intense immune response against Ae. albopictus in DENV3-positive M. arctoides. Current findings support the concept of salivary biomarkers using accessible SGE, available from mosquito colonies of interest. However, we observed cross-reactivity between Aedes species because of crude SGE containing species-shared proteins. Nevertheless, a potential risk of pathogen transmission is emphasised between national park visitors and macaques via mosquitoes as bridge vectors. This information contributes to preventive measures against mosquito bites, including those implemented in tourist areas.',\n",

Nevertheless, the majority of symbionts remain resistant to cultivation. Characterizing the diversity and function of bacterial genomes in mosquito specimens, therefore, relies on metagenomics and subsequent assembly and binning strategies. The obtention and analysis of Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from separated organs can notably provide key information about the specific role of mosquito-associated microbes in the ovaries (the reproductive organs), the midgut (key for food digestion and immunity), or the salivary glands (essential for the transmission of vector-borne diseases as pathogens must colonize them to enter the saliva and reach the bloodstream during a blood meal). These newly reconstructed genomes can then pave the way for the development of novel vector biocontrol strategies. To this aim, it is required to isolate mosquito organs while avoiding cross-contamination between them or with microorganisms present in other mosquito organs.

       "  'abstract': 'Mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose significant threats to human populations, especially in developing and underdeveloped regions, where access to effective preventive measures remains limited. Mosquito repellents represent a cornerstone in the arsenal against these diseases, providing a barrier against mosquito bites. Mosquito repellents come in various formulations, including topical ointments and commercial vaporizers, with varying compositions. Common constituents include deodorized kerosene (DOK) as a solvent, pyrethroids, amides, essential oils for fragrance, and synergists. Despite their widespread use, the toxicological profiles of these repellents remain inadequately understood, raising questions about their safety in prolonged or excessive exposure scenarios. However, while their efficacy in preventing mosquito-borne illnesses is well-established, concerns persist regarding their potential toxicity to humans and the environment. This review critically examines the existing literature on the toxicity of mosquito repellents, focusing on their adverse effects on human health and environmental sustainability. Through an extensive analysis of available research, this review aims to shed light on the potential health risks associated with mosquito repellents, such as dermatological irritation, respiratory complications, and allergic reactions in humans.',\n",

In recent years, emerging and re-emerging vector-borne diseases have gained attention as they can cause a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations. The neurological manifestations of vector-borne viruses encompass a board spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild and self-limiting symptoms to severe and life-threatening conditions. Common neurological complications include viral encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, and various neuromuscular disorders. The specific viruses responsible for these neurological sequelae vary by geographic region and include Orthoflavivirus nilense, Zika virus, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. This review focuses on the pathogenesis of these neurologic complications and highlights the mechanisms by which vector-borne viruses invade the central nervous system and trigger neuroinflammatory responses.

Forty-two paediatric patients were enrolled, with a median onset age of five years. All patients presented with papulovesicular lesions, and 32 systemic HVLPD (sHVLPD) patients had systemic symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and liver dysfunction. Of the sHVLPD cases, 13 also had severe mosquito bite allergy (SMBA). Twenty-five cases were T-type, and nine were CD56+-dominant type. Follow-up data showed that 12 patients had complete remission, and three patients died.

Malnutrition can increase both host susceptibility and severity of infection through a number of pathways, and infection itself can promote nutritional deterioration and further susceptibility. Nutritional status can also strongly influence response to vaccination or therapeutic pharmaceuticals. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) have a long history of infecting humans, resulting in regular pandemics as well as an increasing frequency of autochthonous transmission. Interestingly, aside from host-related factors, nutrition could also play a role in the competence of vectors required for transmission of these viruses. Nutritional status of the host and vector could even influence viral evolution itself. Therefore, it is vital to understand the role of nutrition in the arbovirus lifecycle.

Risk of mosquito- borne illness varies greatly with occupation, age, ethnicity, gender, income status, travel frequency, and climate change. Those at most risk of being infected by a mosquito-borne disease include frequent travelers, healthcare personnel, laboratory workers, and those whose occupation is mostly conducted outside or in wooded areas. Many people become sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Some people have mild short-term illness and in cases some people experience long-term illnesses. Severe cases of mosquito-borne diseases have resulted in death.

This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth overview of MBDs in India, emphasizing their impact and potential implications for global health. The article explores distribution, epidemiology, control or elimination, and economic burden of the prevalent diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, and lymphatic filariasis, which collectively contribute to millions of cases annually. It sheds light on their profound effects on morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic burdens and the potential for international transmission through travel and trade. The challenges and perspectives associated with controlling mosquito populations are highlighted, underscoring the importance of effective public health communication for prevention and early detection. The potential for these diseases to spread beyond national borders is recognized, necessitating a holistic approach to address the challenge. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, covering the past five decades (1972-2022), utilizing databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar, in addition to in-person library consultations. The literature review analyzed 4,082 articles initially identified through various databases. After screening and eligibility assessment, 252 articles were included for analysis. The review focused on malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, and lymphatic filariasis. The included studies focused on MBDs occurrence in India, while those conducted outside India, lacking statistical analysis, or published before 1970 were excluded. This review provides valuable insights into the status of MBDs in India and underscores the need for concerted efforts to combat these diseases on both national and global scales through consilience.',\n",

They include 37 genera, all within a single family, the Culicidae, itself divided into 3 sub-families, Toxorhynchitinae, Anophelinae, and Culicinae. They occur in tropical and temperate zones, even above the Arctic Circle but are absent in the Antarctic. They are found as high as 6,000 m (above sea level) in mountainous regions and as deep as 1,250 m (below sea level) in caves and mines (Lane & Crosskey, 1993). If there is obviously an academic interest in the description and understanding of mosquito biodiversity, its study is also a major issue because of the risk associated with invasive species and the emergence and spread of vector-borne diseases. The efficiency, speed and reach of modern transport networks put indeed people at risk from the emergence of new strains of familiar diseases or completely new diseases (Guimera et al., 2005). The global growth of economic activity, tourism, and human migration is leading to ever more cases of the movement of both diseases vectors and the pathogens they carry (Tatem et al., 2006b), increasing at the same time the biodiversity of mosquitoes around the world. In the current context of global warming, the expansion of areas suitable for the major disease vectors is becoming a threat and even a reality for some regions with several species being classified as invasive. To temperate this point, it is important to mention that among all mosquito species recorded, only 10% are regarded as efficient vectors of infectious agents having a considerable impact on human welfare and health. However, this small fraction is responsible for some of the worst scourges of humankind and the most important vectors belong essentially to three genera including Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex among which some species have been quite successful of wide-scale invasions. An invasive species is defined as a species having a great impact on its new environment and spreading with measurable growth and distance dispersed (Daehler, 2001). Three major biological characteristics are found among the most invasive mosquito species, their close association with humans, egg resistance to desiccation (genus Aedes), and small larval habitats such as a wide variety of water holding containers among which man-made ones',\n",

Mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) cause major human diseases in this continent. Current knowledge suggests that MBD range could expand dramatically in response to CC. This study aimed at assessing the relationship between CC and MBD in Africa. Methods For this purpose, a systematic peer review was carried out, considering all articles indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase and CENTRAL. Search terms referring to MBD, CC and environmental factors were screened in title, abstract and keywords.Results A total of twenty-nine studies were included, most of them on malaria (61%), being Anopheles spp. (61%) the most commonly analyzed vector, mainly in Eastern Africa (48%). Seventy-nine percent of these studies were based on predictive models. Seventy-two percent of the reviewed studies considered that CC impacts on MBD epidemiology. MBD prevalence will increase according to 69% of the studies while 17% predicted a decrease. MBD expansion throughout the continent was also predicted. Most studies showed a positive relationship between observed or predicted results and CC. However, there was a great heterogeneity in methodologies and a tendency to reductionism, not integrating other variables that interact with both the environment and MBD. In addition, most results have not yet been tested. A global health approach is desirable in this kind of research.

The most common mosquito-borne viruses causing recent epidemics include flaviviruses in the family Flaviviridae, including Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) and Togaviridae viruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Several factors may have contributed to the recent re-emergence and spread of mosquito-borne viral diseases. Among these important causes are the evolution of mosquito-borne viruses and the genetic mutations that make them more adaptive and virulent, leading to widespread epidemics. RNA viruses tend to acquire genetic diversity due to error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, thus promoting high mutation rates that support adaptation to environmental changes or host immunity. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the adaptive evolution of mosquito-borne viruses and their impact on viral infectivity, pathogenicity, vector fitness, transmissibility, epidemic potential and disease emergence.',\n",

The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes is one promising strategy to curb dengue virus (DENV) transmission, and a recent CRT reported impressive reductions in dengue incidence following the release of these mosquitoes. Such trials can be affected by multiple sources of bias, however. We used mathematical models of DENV transmission during a CRT of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to explore three such biases: human movement, mosquito movement and coupled transmission dynamics between trial arms. We show that failure to account for each of these biases would lead to underestimated efficacy, and that the majority of this underestimation is due to a heretofore unrecognised bias caused by transmission coupling. Taken together, our findings suggest that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes could be even more promising than the recent CRT suggested. By emphasising the importance of accounting for transmission coupling between arms, which requires a mathematical model, we highlight the key role that models can play in interpreting and extrapolating the results from trials of vector control interventions.',\n",

Yellow fever and dengue viruses, with mosquito vectors similar to West Nile and Zika viruses, are endemic in many tropical areas of the world and produce frequent outbreaks. The global distribution of yellow fever and dengue viruses could also change and has great potential to do so. Factors that could contribute to reemergence of the diseases in areas of the world where they are currently only seen in travelers, include the presence of yellow fever and dengue virus vectors in temperate climates and growing urbanization.

       "  'abstract': 'ABSTRACT An immunomodulatory role of arthropod saliva has been well documented, but evidence for an effect on Plasmodium sp. infectiousness remains controversial. Mosquito saliva may orient the immune response toward a Th2 profile, thereby priming a Th2 response against subsequent antigens, including Plasmodium. Orientation toward a Th1 versus a Th2 profile promotes IgG and IgE proliferation, respectively, where the former is crucial for the development of an efficient antiparasite immune response. Here we assessed the direct effect of mosquito bites on the density of Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites and the prevalence of gametocytes in chronic, asymptomatic infections in a longitudinal cohort study of seasonal transmission. We additionally correlated these parasitological measures with IgE and IgG antiparasite and anti-salivary gland extract titers. The mosquito biting density was positively correlated with the asexual parasite density but not asexual parasite prevalence and was negatively correlated with gametocyte prevalence. Individual anti-salivary gland IgE titers were also negatively correlated with gametocyte carriage and were strongly positively correlated with antiparasite IgE titers, consistent with the hypothesis that mosquito bites predispose individuals to develop an IgE antiparasite response. We provide evidence that mosquito bites have an impact on asymptomatic infections and differentially so for the production of asexual and sexual parasites. An increased research focus on the immunological impact of mosquito bites during asymptomatic infections is warranted, to establish whether strategies targeting the immune response to saliva can reduce the duration of infection and the onward transmission of the parasite.',\n",

As climate changes may facilitate increasing distribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in such settings, there is a need to monitor changes in risks of exposure to ensure that established control tools meet the required needs. This study explored the use of human antibodies against gambiae salivary gland protein 6 peptide 1 (gSG6-P1) as a biomarker of Anopheles exposure and assessed temporal exposure to mosquito bites in populations living in Lower Moshi, Northern Tanzania. Methods Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2019: during the dry season in March, at the end of the rainy season in June and during the dry season in September. Blood samples were collected from enrolled participants and analysed for the presence of anti-gSG6-P1 IgG. Mosquitoes were sampled from 10% of the participants’ households, quantified and identified to species level. Possible associations between gSG6-P1 seroprevalence and participants’ characteristics were determined. Results The total number of Anopheles mosquitoes collected was highest during the rainy season (n = 1364) when compared to the two dry seasons (n = 360 and n = 1075, respectively). The gSG6-P1 seroprevalence increased from 18.8% during the dry season to 25.0% during the rainy season (χ2 = 2.66; p = 0.103) followed by a significant decline to 11.0% during the next dry season (χ2 = 12.56; p = 0.001). The largest number of mosquitoes were collected in one village (Oria), but the seroprevalence was significantly lower among the residents as compared to the rest of the villages (p = 0.039), explained by Oria having the highest number of participants owning and using bed nets. Both individual and household gSG6-P1 IgG levels had no correlation with numbers of Anopheles mosquitoes collected. Conclusion Anti-gSG6-P1 IgG is a potential tool in detecting and distinguishing temporal and spatial variations in exposure to Anopheles mosquito bites in settings of extremely low malaria transmission where entomological tools may be obsolete. However studies with larger sample size and extensive mosquito sampling are warranted to further explore the association between this serological marker and abundance of Anopheles mosquito.',\n",

In the scientific literature, there is practically no information about the risk from mosquito bitesl to human health due to the non-use of these funds. The information on the prevalence, infection of mosquito-carriers of infectious agents was studied; biological risks from non-use of repellents and insecticides. The aim of the study is to develop methodological approaches to assessing the reduction of health risk from mosquito bites due to the use of repellent and insecticidal agents. Materials and methods. The methods of studying relevant scientific literature, analysis of statistical reporting data, the main stages of the methodology for assessing health risks were used. Results. The proposed methodological approaches have been tested in various scenarios for the use of repellents and insecticides in comparison with the averted risks associated with the development of infectious diseases carried by mosquitoes. Conclusion. For the implementation of methodological approaches, scenarios and parameters of the development of the situation with the use of repellents and insecticides or their non-use are proposed. Indicators of individual, population and prevented health risks were calculated, considering the severity of harm to health. The personal health risk of West Nile fever (WNF) and dirofilariasis in non-endemic areas without application repellents and insecticides is assessed as acceptable - 1.2•10-8 and 1.7•10-5, respectively. At the territory with constantly recorded WNV incidence, the application of repellents or insecticides diminished the population risk of contracting fever by ten times. The averted health risk is 0.297 cases per 2.8 million population. When using repellents or insecticides, the population risk of dirofilariasis is significantly reduced.

This study was conducted in the Amichi village in Nigeria's Nnewi South L.G.A. to determine the prevalence of malaria and the abundance of mosquito vectors. Malaria parasites in the blood were found using blood preparation and microscopy. \\nMethodology: 232 people from the town's ten settlements, including 135 men (61.15%) and 97 women (60.82%), took part in the survey. Participants were separated into 8 groups with ten-year intervals and ranged in age from 0 to 80. 142 (61.21%) of the 232 persons that were checked tested positive for malaria parasites. Plasmodium falciparum 135 (95.07%), Plasmodium malariae 6 (4.23%), and Plasmodium ovale 1 (0.70%) were the malaria parasites found in the study. Malaria prevalence was highest in the age group 51–60 years (16, 72.72%) and lowest in the age group 21–30 years (12, 50.00%). Age-related differences in the prevalence of malaria were not significant (p>0.05; 11.07, df=14). Males had a little higher infection rate than females (59(60.82%)), although this difference was not statistically significant (0.548 d.f = 2, p>0.05). \\nResults: Farmers were marginally more likely to contract malaria than other occupational categories, but there were significant differences among them (P>0.05). Anopheles gambiae larvae made up 51 (14.63%) of the 351 mosquito larvae collected, with Aedes albopictus larvae making up 117 (33.33%), and the result was statistically significant (694.6 d.f.=12; P0.05). Anopheles gambiae produced the highest yield of mosquitoes, 12 (46.15%), while Aedes albopictus produced the lowest, and the Pyrethrum Knockdown collection (PKC) of indoor biting and resting adult mosquitoes produced 26 mosquitoes in 4 villages. \\nConclusion: The results of the study showed that Anopheles gambiae breed in all villages thus every person in the town is at risk of malaria attack. Attributes of the rate of exposure of the study population to vector bites due to the nature of their work and standard of living from a factor in the transmission pattern of the disease.

The disease is widely prevalent in all parts of the country with variation in intensity including Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of India. Though the disease is known to be urban in nature, cases are being reported from rural areas too. Uttar Pradesh experienced a statewide outbreak of dengue in 2016 and reported 15033 cases and 42 deaths, of which 2772 cases (18.44% of the state) and 18 deaths (42.86% of the state) occurred in the district of Lucknow. The disease is tackled under the guidelines of the Directorate of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). Accordingly, source reduction and prevention from mosquito bites are the most important techniques in order to prevent the disease spread. Various means like pamphlets and posters containing signs and symptoms of the disease including source reduction and prevention from mosquito bites, written in simple language (Hindi), video clips etc. were used as health educational material. Selected secondary/junior schools were visited as per daily schedule during the month of July in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The sensitisation of the school children played a significant role in bringing down dengue morbidity by 83.73% and 74.74% and mortality by 88.89% and 94.44%, during 2017 and 2018, respectively in comparison to 2016, whereas the case fatality rate (CFR) declined from 0.65% in 2016 to 0.14% in 2018, as the school children along with their teachers played an important role in sensitisation towards the prevention of dengue, due to which they not only became actively involved but also communicated the required messages pertaining to the elimination of breeding sites and prevention from mosquito bites.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SUMMARY The prevalence of vector-borne parasites varies greatly across host species, and this heterogeneity has been used to relate infectious disease susceptibility to host species traits. However, a few empirical studies have directly associated vector-borne parasite prevalence with exposure to vectors across hosts. Here, we use DNA sequencing of blood meals to estimate utilization of different avian host species by Culex mosquitoes, and relate utilization by these malaria vectors to avian Plasmodium prevalence. We found that avian host species that are highly utilized as hosts by avian malaria vectors are significantly more likely to have Plasmodium infections. However, the effect was not consistent among individual Plasmodium taxa. Exposure to vector bites may therefore influence the relative number of all avian Plasmodium infections among host species, while other processes, such as parasite competition and host-parasite coevolution, delimit the host distributions of individual Plasmodium species. We demonstrate that links between avian malaria susceptibility and host traits can be conditioned by patterns of exposure to vectors. Linking vector utilization rates to host traits may be a key area of future research to understand mechanisms that produce variation in the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens among host species.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ab stract. The true prevalence of allergy to mosquitoes and many other types of insects is unknown, since practical allergology currently lacks a sufficient list of insect allergens for diagnosing this type of allergy. However, it has been established that allergic reactions to the bites of bloodsucking insects occur in 17-20 % of people suffering from atopic diseases. The occurrence of such an allergic reaction can be observed both in adults (most often between the ages of 16 and 35) and in children. Th e main source of mosquito allergens is their saliva, which enters the human body as a result of the bites of these insects. In addition, during a mosquito bite, it is possible to enter the human body and the products of the insect’s vital activity, which can also cause sensitization of the body to these antigens. To date, 12 polypeptides from the saliva of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Mosguitoes) have been described and their allergenic properties have been proven. A number of studies have revealed crossreactivity of mosquito allergens with allergens of other arthropods, in particular, individuals with hypersensitivity to the venom of wasps, bees, dust mites, cockroaches and shrimp may be susceptible to hypersensitivity reactions due to contact with Aedes aegypti. At the basis of the pathogenesis of allergy to mosquitoes, as well as to other non-stinging insects, are both IgE-induced reactions of the immediate type, and allergic reactions of the immunocomplex and delayed types. That is why the clinical manifestations of allergy to mosquitoes can be different and have a local, systemic or mainly visceral (with damage to certain organs and tissues) character. With a local allergic reaction, swelling and hyperemia of the skin at the site of the bite, pronounced skin itching, usually develop. In the late phase of the IgE-induced reaction, these symptoms are observed 3-12 hours after the bite. Sy stemic allergic reactions in this type of allergy are identical (mild, moderate, severe, anaphylactic shock) to those observed in hymenoptera insect stings. Evidence of the presence of allergy to mosquitoes is the connection of clinical manifestations of an allergic reaction with a mosquito bite, the presence of positive skin tests (if they are available) with extracts of allergens from mosquito saliva, as well as the presence of specific IgE-antibodies to the mosquito allergen in the blood serum of patients. Tr eatment of patients with mosquito allergy consists of providing emergency care for systemic allergic reactions, usage of second-generation antihistamines, local corticosteroids and allergen-specific immunotherapy. Prevention of mosquito bites, especially in humans with allergy to mosquito, is key and is accomplished primarily through physical barriers and chemical repellents.',\n",

It is important to promote the concept of health as the result of the interaction of human beings and their total environment. METHODS : This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. A cluster sampling technique was used to select the participants into the study. The study was carried out between January 2012 and February 2012. One participant per household was selected into the study. A semi- structured questionnaire was used to collect relevant information which was collated and analyzed using SPSS 15 statistical software. RESULTS : A total of 400 households were recruited into the study. The prevalence of insecticide spray utilization in the last 6months was 18.5%. Source of information on the use of insecticides included the radio/TV 174 (43.5%), Relatives 78 (19.5%), Health workers 54 (13.5%), friends 68 (17.0%) and others 26 (6.5%). Reasons for not using insecticides included being expensive (cost) 94 (23.5%), fear of side effect 16 (4.0%), Inconvenience 38 (9.5%) and un-availability 74 (18.5%). Predictors of utilization of insecticide spray were young age (<30 yrs) of heads of household (O.R=5.10, C.I=1.06-21.7), tertiary education (OR= 9.14 C.I=1.13-53.08), Nuclear family structure (OR=2.45 C.I=1.13-3.74) and availability of insecticide spray (OR=2.21 C.I=1.24-4.05).

RAS invade hepatocytes but do not replicate. CD8+ T cells recognizing parasite-derived peptides on the surface of infected hepatocytes are likely the primary protective mechanism. We conducted a randomized clinical trial of RAS immunization to assess safety, to achieve 50% vaccine efficacy (VE) against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI), and to generate reagents from protected and non-protected subjects for future identification of protective immune mechanisms and antigens. Methods Two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) of healthy, malaria-naïve, non-pregnant adults age 18–50 received five monthly immunizations with infected (true-immunized, n = 21) or non-infected (mock-immunized, n = 5) mosquito bites and underwent homologous CHMI at 3 weeks. Immunization parameters were selected for 50% protection based on prior clinical data. Leukapheresis was done to collect plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results Adverse event rates were similar in true- and mock-immunized subjects. Two true- and two mock-immunized subjects developed large local reactions likely caused by mosquito salivary gland antigens. In Cohort 1, 11 subjects received 810–1235 infected bites; 6/11 (55%) were protected against CHMI vs. 0/3 mock-immunized and 0/6 infectivity controls (VE 55%). In Cohort 2, 10 subjects received 839–1131 infected bites with a higher first dose and a reduced fifth dose; 9/10 (90%) were protected vs. 0/2 mock-immunized and 0/6 controls (VE 90%). Three/3 (100%) protected subjects administered three booster immunizations were protected against repeat CHMI vs. 0/6 controls (VE 100%). Cohort 2 uniquely showed a significant rise in IFN-γ responses after the third and fifth immunizations and higher antibody responses to CSP. Conclusions PfRAS were generally safe and well tolerated. Cohort 2 had a higher first dose, reduced final dose, higher antibody responses to CSP and significant rise of IFN-γ responses after the third and fifth immunizations.

       "  'abstract': 'In this issue of Leukemia & Lymphoma, Li and colleagues present an innovative pioneering study in the field of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-associated insect-bite reactions.[1] Experienced clinicians are well aware of the phenomenon that patients with CLL, as well as lymphoma, often develop large local reactions to insect-bites. These sort of ‘super-atopic reactions’ after insect-bites can even occur in patients that harbor a subclinical lymphoid neoplasm, presenting as a precursor lesion. This phenomenon is not at all rare, and after carefully searching the literature, the prevalence of local reactions to mosquito bites is reported to be as high as 45% of patients with CLL in some series.[2] However, most of these publications are generally isolated case reports or only small case series.[3,4] The largest series to date on this topic was recorded recently in 2012 by the Israeli CLL Study Group and reviewed the national experience with insect-bite-like reaction.[5] This earlier study comprised 48 patients (25 males, 23 females) with a mean age of 64.8 years at the time of the skin eruption. Data on clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic characteristics, treatment, and outcome were collected from the medical files and the mean time between diagnosis of CLL and the appearance of the skin lesions was 3.1 years (range 4 months to 14 years). The eruptions were not related to CLL activity or the individual course of the hematological disease. The eruption preceded the diagnosis of CLL (by 0–4 years) in 10 patients and followed the diagnosis of CLL in 36 cases; in 11 patients, it occurred during therapy for CLL and in nine after therapy. Mean duration of the skin findings was 21.5 months (range 0.3–132 months) and the eruption usually presented in summer, although it also occurred in other seasons of the year. Skin findings mostly affected the upper and lower limbs, but also appeared on unexposed areas. Treatment given included local ointments, antihistaminics, oral steroids, antibiotics, phototherapy, and dapsone with varying responses. The Israeli CLL Study Group concluded that insect-bite-like reactions may be related to the immune dysregulation associated with CLL and could in addition possibly be further exacerbated by external factors, including actual insect-bites, chemoimmunotherapy, and pyogenic infections.[5] The novel aspect of the Australian investigation reported here in this issue of Leukemia & Lymphoma by Li and colleagues relates to the proposed mechanism of action: they detected upregulation of CD63 on basophils when they used cells from atopic donors that were incubated with serum from CLL patients with local insect-bite reactions.[1] In contrast, basophils from non-atopic donors showed no effect with regard to CD63 expression after exposure to CLL sera. In this respect it worth noting, that basophils from atopic donors have a higher surface density of FceRI. Therefore, the authors conclude that CLL patients have factors that lead to basophil activation, most probably autoantibodies against surface FceRI on basophils.[6] Future studies including immunoblotting based on recombinant FceRI will have to show whether basophil activation via the high affinity IgE receptor is really critical in this setting. Although only speculation at this point, it is thought that autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor of both basophils, and also mast cells may be another key player in this autoreactive storm after mosquito bites in patients with CLL. Despite the fact that the results presented in this pilot study are based on only a small cohort of patients, these preliminary observations may stimulate',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the outbreak of the war, thousands of military personnel have been stationed in islands of the South Pacific where a non-periodic type of Bancroftian filariasis is prevalent among the native populations, and large numbers of the troops, who have been intensively exposed to the bites of infected mosquitoes, have developed clinical manifestations of filariasis. The pattern of the disease in these men is similar to that described many years ago (1) in Europeans, a few months after their arrival in these same island groups, and consists primarily of a lymphadenitis and remittent lymphangitis, sometimes associated with constitutional symptoms of low-grade fever, chills, malaise, and nausea. The natives are well acquainted with this syndrome and call it \"mumu.\" The chief manifestations of \"mumu,\" as seen among the troops, are lymphadenopathy of the axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear nodes, with recurrent attacks of a retrograde or centrifugal lymphangitis, and the appearance of evanescent red, swollen, pruritic areas on the affected trunk or extremities (2, 3). The spermatic cord and scrotal contents are frequently affected, the commonest lesion being a funiculitis, with or without epididymitis, orchitis, or hydrocele (4). In the majority of cases, a definitive diagnosis of filariasis cannot be made, since microfilariae have thus far been found but rarely in the blood (3, 5); but the adult parasites have been recovered from involved lymph nodes in a number of patients (6, 7), and skin tests with filarial antigens have yielded positive results in about 85 per cent of the men with clinical evidence of the disease (2, 3, 6, 8). The mechanism which excites the attacks of lymphangitis and fugitive swellings in these cases is of great interest. The aforementioned observers are in general agreement that the chief factor is a sensitization of the host to antigenic substances elaborated by the adult parasites, and that the symptoms are the result of an immune or allergic type of reaction. This opinion is supported by the high incidence of positive skin tests, precipitin tests, and complement fixation reactions with filarial antigens among supposedly infected troops (2, 3, 6, 8), indicating that the majority have developed antibodies to the parasite; by the microscopic appearance of the tissue changes in biopsy specimens (6, 7); and by the fact that the local reactions occurring spontaneously in these naturally infected individuals may be reproduced in many of them following the intradermal inoculation of filarial antigens (2). Another possible mechanism for the recurrent lymphangitis is secondary bacterial infection, since it is well-known from earlier work (9) that lymph stasis and lymph edema predispose to bacterial invasion, particularly with hemolytic streptococci. Furthermore, the so-called \"tropical lymphangitis\" of the Caribbean area, which clinically resembles the lymphangitis of \"mumu\" in some respects, has been definitely shown by bacteriological and serological procedures frequently to be initiated by streptococcal infections (10). The infectious etiology of the lymphangitis seen in the cases of filariasis among military personnel has been investigated, using ordinary bacteriological procedures, and thus far cultures have failed to reveal hemolytic streptococci (6, 7). Cultural methods alone may, however, be inadequate, as was clearly demonstrated in cases of tropical lymphangitis (11), in which it was found to be difficult to isolate streptococci at the time of the attacks. It was shown, nevertheless, that the attacks were engendered by a streptococcal infection, since the majority of these cases subsequently showed an immune response characterized by an augmented titer of antistreptolysin \"O\" in the blood.',\n",

Current miRNA studies in mosquitoes include four steps, namely, identifying miRNAs, validating miRNA-pathogen interactions, exploring action mechanisms, and performing preapplication investigations. Notably, regarding the Plasmodium parasite, mosquito miRNAs generally bind to mosquito immunity- or development-related mRNAs, indirectly regulating Plasmodium infection; However, regarding arboviruses, mosquito miRNAs can bind to the viral genome, directly modifying viral replication. Thus, during explorations of miRNA-based approaches, researchers need select an ideal miRNA for investigation based on the mosquito species, tissue, and mosquito-borne pathogen of interest.

West Nile virus (WNV) and avian malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium, are mosquito-borne pathogens that may produce severe disease and illness in humans and birds, respectively, and circulate in an endemic form in southern Europe. Here, we used field-collected data to identify the impact of Culex pipiens, Cx. perexiguus and Cx. modestus, on the circulation of both WNV and Plasmodium in Andalusia (SW Spain) using mathematical modelling of the basic reproduction number (R0 ). Models were calibrated with field-collected data on WNV seroprevalence and Plasmodium infection in wild house sparrows, presence of WNV and Plasmodium in mosquito pools, and mosquito blood feeding patterns. This approach allowed us to determine the contribution of each vector species to pathogen amplification. Overall, 0.7% and 29.6% of house sparrows were positive to WNV antibodies and Plasmodium infection, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of Plasmodium was higher in Cx. pipiens (2.0%), followed by Cx. perexiguus (1.8%) and Cx. modestus (0.7%). Three pools of Cx. perexiguus were positive to WVN. Models identified Cx. perexiguus as the most important species contributing to the amplification of WNV in southern Spain. For Plasmodium models, R0 values were higher when Cx. pipiens was present in the population, either alone or in combination with the other mosquito species. These results suggest that the transmission of these vector borne pathogens depends on different Culex species and consequently their transmission niches will present different spatial and temporal patterns. For WNV, targeted surveillance and control of Cx. perexiguus populations appears as the most effective measure to reduce WNV amplification. Also, preventing Culex populations near human settlements, or reducing the abundance of these species, are potential strategies to reduce WNV spillover into human populations in southern Spain.',\n",

Arthropod vectors experience a complex suite of environmental factors that affect fitness, population growth and species interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Temperature and water availability are two of the most important abiotic variables influencing their distributions and abundances. While extensive research on temperature exists, the influence of humidity on vector and pathogen parameters affecting disease dynamics are less understood. Humidity is often underemphasized, and when considered, is often treated as independent of temperature even though desiccation likely contributes to declines in trait performance at warmer temperatures. This Perspectives explores how humidity shapes the thermal performance of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. We summarize what is known about its effects and propose a conceptual model for how temperature and humidity interact to shape the range of temperatures across which mosquitoes persist and achieve high transmission potential. We discuss how failing to account for these interactions hinders efforts to forecast transmission dynamics and respond to epidemics of mosquito-borne infections. We outline future research areas that will ground the effects of humidity on the thermal biology of pathogen transmission in a theoretical and empirical framework to improve spatial and temporal prediction of vector-borne pathogen transmission.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since past century, vector-borne diseases have been a major public health concern in several states of Mexico. However, Mexico City continues to be free of endemic mosquito-borne viral diseases. The city is the most important politic and economic state of Mexico and one of the most important city of Latin America. Its subtropical highland climate and high elevation (2240 masl) had historically made the occurrence of Aedes species unlikely. However, the presence of other potential disease vectors (Culex spp, Culiseta spp), and the current intermittent introductions of Aedes aegypti, have revealed that control programs must adopt routine vector surveillance in the city. In this study, we provide an updated species list from a five-years of vector surveillance performed in Mexico City. A total of 18,553 mosquito larvae were collected. Twenty-two species from genus Culex, Aedes, Culiseta, Anopheles, Lutzia and Uranotaenia were observed. Nine new mosquito records for the city were found. Ae. albopictus was recorded for the first time in Mexico City. Interestingly, a new record, Ae. epactius was the most frequent species reported. Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus exhibited the highest number of individuals collected. We detected six areas which harbor the highest mosquito species records in the city. Cemeteries included 68.9% of our collection sites. Temporarily ponds showed the highest species diversity. We detected an increasing presence of Ae. aegypti, which was detected for three consecutive years (2015–2017), predominantly in the warmer microclimates of the city. We found a possible correlation between increasing temperature and Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus expanding range. This study provides a starting point for developing strategies related to environmental management for mosquito control. The promotion of mosquito control practices through community participation, mass media and education programmes in schools should be introduced in the city.',\n",

Some mosquito species have been associated directly with transmission of the virus in South America, although the importance given to each species varies depending on the bibliography, geographical location, or year of publication. For Argentina, few publications have assessed the involvement of mosquito species, especially those included in the sylvatic cycle.

In order to better assess the risk of mosquito-borne disease-agent transmission in zoos, potential vector species must be known, as well as the communities in which they occur. For this reason, species composition and dynamics were examined in 2016 in two zoological gardens in Germany. Using different methods for mosquito sampling, a total of 2,257 specimens belonging to 20 taxa were collected. Species spectra depended on the collection method but generally differed between the two zoos, while species compositions and relative abundances varied seasonally in both of them. As both sampled zoos were located in the same climatic region and potential breeding sites within the zoos were similar, the differences in mosquito compositions are attributed to immigration of specimens from surrounding landscapes, although the different sizes of the zoos and the different blood host populations available probably also have an impact. Based on the differences in species composition and the various biological characteristics of the species, the risk of certain pathogens to be transmitted must also be expected to differ between the zoos.',\n",

Vector surveillance and control activities are often focused at the household level. Little is known about the importance of nonhousehold sites, including schools, in maintaining vector-borne disease transmission. The objectives of this paper were to determine the mosquito species composition in rural schools in 2 municipalities in Colombia and to assess the potential risk of vector-borne disease transmission in school settings. Entomological surveys were carried out in rural schools during the dry and rainy seasons of 2011. A total of 12 mosquito species were found: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles pseudopunctipennis, Culex coronator, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Limatus durhamii in both immature and adult forms; Ae. fluviatilis, Cx. nigripalpus, Cx. corniger, and Psorophora ferox in immature forms only; and Ae. angustivittatus, Haemagogus equinus, and Trichoprosopon lampropus in adult forms only. The most common mosquito species was Cx. quinquefasciatus. Classrooms contained the greatest abundance of adult female Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The most common Ae. aegypti breeding sites were containers classified as “others” (e.g., cans), followed by containers used for water storage. A high level of Ae. aegypti infestation was found during the wet season. Our results suggest that rural schools are potentially important foci for the transmission of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases.

Here we study how host species’ abundance and competence (duration and titre of parasitaemia) influence host importance during epidemic scenarios. We evaluate this theory using Ross River virus (RRV, family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), a multi-host mosquito-borne disease with significant human health impacts across Australia and Papua New Guinea. We used host contribution models to find the importance of key hosts (possums, wallabies, kangaroos, horses, humans) in typical mammal communities around five Australian epidemic centres. We found humans and possums contributed most to epidemic RRV transmission, owing to their high abundances, generally followed by macropods. This supports humans as spillover hosts, and that human–mosquito and possum–mosquito transmission is predominant during epidemics. Sensitivity analyses indicate these findings to be robust across epidemic centres. We emphasize the importance of considering abundance and competence in identifying key hosts (during epidemics in this case), and that competence alone is inadequate. Knowledge of host importance in disease transmission may help to equip health agencies to bring about greater effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Simple Summary In this study, we present the characterization of Aedes aegypti mosquito salivary protein, LTRIN (lymphotoxin β receptor inhibitor), a key facilitator of ZIKV transmission. Injected into the human host during blood-feeding, LTRIN interacts with the human receptor LTβR. We found that LTRIN exists as a thermostable protein with homodimers consisting of an alpha helix-dominant secondary structure with two EF-hand motifs, crucial for withstanding temperature fluctuations during blood-feeding. Despite being an EF-hand protein, its secondary structure remains unaffected by Ca2+ binding. ELISA assays and HDX-MS experiments identified the binding region of LTRIN with LTβR. Disrupting the calcium-binding ability in the second EF-hand motif significantly impacted the interaction between LTRIN, particularly the 15 kDa C-terminal protein, ΔLTRIN, and LTβR. Moreover, the decrease in binding affinity of full-length LTRIN suggests the presence of only the truncated form, ΔLTRIN, in the mosquito’s saliva, as the N-terminal region likely covers the interaction site. This insight provides a basis for developing inhibitors against LTRIN as a potential treatment or vaccine target for ZIKV. Abstract Salivary proteins from mosquitoes have received significant attention lately due to their potential to develop therapeutic treatments or vaccines for mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we report the characterization of LTRIN (lymphotoxin beta receptor inhibitor), a salivary protein known to enhance the pathogenicity of ZIKV by interrupting the LTβR-initiated NF-κB signaling pathway and, therefore, diminish the immune responses. We demonstrated that the truncated C-terminal LTRIN (ΔLTRIN) is a dimeric protein with a stable alpha helix-dominant secondary structure, which possibly aids in withstanding the temperature fluctuations during blood-feeding events. ΔLTRIN possesses two Ca2+ binding EF-hand domains, with the second EF-hand motif playing a more significant role in interacting with LTβR. Additionally, we mapped the primary binding regions of ΔLTRIN on LTβR using hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and identified that 91QEKAHIAEHMDVPIDTSKMSEQELQFHY118 from the N-terminal of ΔLTRIN is the major interacting region. Together, our studies provide insight into the recognition of LTRIN by LTβR. This finding may aid in a future therapeutic and transmission-blocking vaccine development against ZIKV.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus in the family Phenuiviridae. In Africa, outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) usually occur following periods of heavy rainfall that prompt population surges in mosquito vectors. RVF causes significant mortality in ruminants, especially in ovine fetuses and neonates (up to 100%), while human infections cause mild febrile illness to hemorrhagic fever and death. Macrophages play a critical role as phagocytes in the innate immune system and produce cytokines that stimulate the adaptive immune system. As in other arboviral diseases, macrophages and dendritic cells are thought to be early infection targets of RVFV, enabling the virus to suppress the immune response. To further investigate their role in RVF early immune response and cytokine induction, bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cell‐derived macrophages were infected with RVFV MP‐12 (an attenuated vaccine strain) in the presence and absence of Culex tarsalis saliva. We hypothesized that in macrophages treated with Culex saliva and RVFV will have increased transcription of Th2‐associated cytokines compared to those infected with virus only due to immunomodulatory proteins present in mosquito saliva. The macrophage lineage of the cells and RVFV infection were confirmed by dual label immunofluorescence for IBA‐1 (macrophage marker) and RVFV nucleoprotein. Total RNA was extracted from 3 biological replicates of macrophages treated respectively with saliva only, MP‐12 only, MP‐12 and saliva at 0, 8 and 24 hours post‐infection (hpi) as well as untreated controls. RNA was reverse‐transcribed and the resulting cDNA analyzed by qPCR of four housekeeping genes (ActinB, H3F3, PPIA, YWHAZ), 6 early response genes (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG1, MDA5, IFNa) and 9 cytokine genes (IL4, IL6, IL10, IL12b, IL18, IFNg, TNFa, IL1a, IL1b). Relative gene expression (RGE) was determined by the method described by Vandesompele which uses multiple reference genes for normalization and does not assume equal PCR efficiencies for the reference genes and genes of interest. RGEs for each target were log‐transformed and analyzed with two‐way ANOVAs and Tukey's post‐hoc test with p‐value correction for multiple tests to evaluate statistical differences between treatments and time points. There was no statistical increase in transcription of Th2‐associated cytokines when bovine macrophages were infected with MP‐12 in the presence of saliva at any of the time points when compared to virus only. In contrast, significant differences in gene expression were present when infected samples were compared to uninfected controls. At 8 hpi, transcription was significantly different than controls for all virus infected samples for TLR3, RIG1, MDA and IFNa as well as IL6, IL10, IL12b, IL18, TNFa, IL1a and IL1b. This trend continued at 24 hpi with the exception of IL12b. While Culex saliva may not enhance suppression of the early immune response in MP‐12 infection, it may still have a role in virulent RVFV strain infections.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"West Nile Virus (WNV) is a flavivirus involved in many human infections worldwide. This arthropod-borne virus is directly co-inoculated with mosquito saliva through the epidermis and the dermis during blood meal. WNV starts replicating in the skin before migrating to the draining lymph node, leading to widespread viremia and in some cases to neurological symptoms. Skin is a complex organ composed of different cell types that together perform essential functions such as pathogen sensing, barrier maintenance and immunity. Keratinocytes, which represent 90% of the cells of the epidermis, are the organism's first line of defense, initiating innate immune response by recognizing pathogens through their pattern recognition receptors. Although WNV was previously known to replicate in human primary keratinocytes, the induced inflammatory response remains unknown. The aim of this study was first to characterize the inflammatory response of human primary keratinocytes to WNV infection and then, to assess the potential role of co-inoculated mosquito saliva on the keratinocyte immune response and viral replication. A type I and III interferon inflammatory response associated with an increase of IRF7 but not IRF3 mRNA expression, and dependent on infectious dose, was observed during keratinocyte infection with WNV. Expression of several interferon-stimulated gene mRNA was also increased at 24 h post-infection (p.i.); they included CXCL10 and interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)-2 sustained up until 48 h p.i. Moreover, WNV infection of keratinocyte resulted in a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6) and various chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8 and CCL20) expression. The addition of Aedes aegypti or Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito saliva, two vectors of WNV infection, to infected keratinocytes led to a decrease of inflammatory response at 24 h p.i. However, only Ae. Aegypti saliva adjunction induced modulation of viral replication. In conclusion, this work describes for the first time the inflammatory response of human primary keratinocytes to WNV infection and its modulation in presence of vector mosquito saliva. The effects of mosquito saliva assessed in this work could be involved in the early steps of WNV replication in skin promoting viral spread through the body.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The global impact of mosquito-borne diseases has increased significantly over recent decades. Ebinur Lake virus (EBIV), a newly classified orthobunyavirus, is reported to be highly pathogenic in adult mice. The evaluation of vector competence is essential for predicting the arbovirus transmission risk. Here, Aedes aegypti was applied to evaluate EBIV infection and dissemination in mosquitos. Our experiments indicated that Ae. aegypti had the possibility to spread EBIV (with a transmission rate of up to 11.8% at 14 days post-infection) through biting, with the highest viral dose in a single mosquito’s saliva reaching 6.3 plaque-forming units. The highest infection, dissemination and ovary infection rates were 70%, 42.9%, and 29.4%, respectively. The high viral infection rates in Ae. aegypti ovaries imply the possibility of EBIV vertical transmission. Ae. aegypti was highly susceptible to intrathoracic infection and the saliva-positive rate reached 90% at 10 days post-infection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed Toll and Imd signaling pathways were implicated in the mosquito’s defensive response to EBIV infection. Defensin C and chitinase 10 were continuously downregulated in mosquitoes infected via intrathoracic inoculation of EBIV. Comprehensive analysis of the vector competence of Ae. aegypti for EBIV in laboratory has indicated the potential risk of EBIV transmission through mosquitoes. Moreover, our findings support a complex interplay between EBIV and the immune system of mosquito, which could affect its vector competence.',\n",

While mosquito saliva is known to be immunogenic, the salivary components driving these immune responses, as well as the types of immune responses that occur, are not well characterized. We investigated the effects of one potential immunomodulatory mosquito saliva protein, sialokinin, on the human immune response. We used flow cytometry to compare human immune cell populations between humanized mice bitten by sialokinin knockout mosquitoes or injected with sialokinin, and compared them to those bitten by wild-type mosquitoes, unbitten, or saline-injected control mice. Humanized mice received 4 mosquito bites or a single injection, were euthanized after 7 days, and skin, spleen, bone marrow, and blood were harvested for immune cell profiling. Our results show that bites from sialokinin knockout mosquitoes induced monocyte and macrophage populations in the skin, blood, bone marrow, and spleens, and primarily affected CD11c- cell populations. Other increased immune cells included plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the blood, natural killer cells in the skin and blood, and CD4+ T cells in all samples analyzed. Conversely, we observed that mice bitten with sialokinin knockout mosquitoes had decreased NKT cell populations in the skin, and fewer B cells in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow. Taken together, we demonstrated that sialokinin knockout saliva induces elements of a TH1 cellular immune response, suggesting that the sialokinin peptide is inducing a TH2 cellular immune response during wild-type mosquito biting. These findings are an important step towards understanding how mosquito saliva modulates the human immune system and which components of saliva may be critical for arboviral infection.

However, delivery of virus by injection via syringe does not fully encompass all aspects of the response that develops after viral delivery via mosquito bite. One reason for this is likely to be the lack of additional immunomodulatory responses specifically induced by mosquito saliva as previous studies have demonstrated profound proviral and immunosuppressive properties of saliva. While the adaptive antiviral response develops in the lymph node draining the site of infection, the impact of mosquito saliva on this critical lymphoid organ has not been extensively explored. Further, the lymphatic system acts both as centralized hubs for immune cell activation and as dissemination pathways to distal tissues, meaning that immunomodulation of the lymphatic system likely affects infection and immunity systemically. Therefore, we explored the effect of mosquito saliva on the structure and function of the draining lymph node in the presence of absence of the mosquito borne arbovirus Zika virus (ZIKV). Preliminary confocal microscopic analyses of lymph nodes after saliva injection into the skin revealed changes in nodal architecture and specific cellular populations. Future studies will explore the impact of saliva specifically on lymphatic endothelial cells within the lymph node.

Volatiles from individuals in an identical twin pair showed a high correlation in attractiveness to mosquitoes, while non-identical twin pairs showed a significantly lower correlation. Overall, there was a strong narrow-sense heritability of 0.62 (SE 0.124) for relative attraction and 0.67 (0.354) for flight activity based on the average of ten measurements. The results demonstrate an underlying genetic component detectable by mosquitoes through olfaction.

       "  'abstract': 'Dear Editor, Severe mosquito bite allergy (SMBA; also known as hypersensitivity to mosquito bites), characterized by high fever and intense local skin symptoms following mosquito bites, is a very rare form of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoproliferative disorder [1]. Owing to its rarity and because the first signs primarily manifest as a cutaneous condition, many clinicians are likely to misdiagnose SMBA as common cellulitis [1]. Although EBV infection and its oncogenic features are well known, SMBA has rarely been reported in Korea [2, 3]. In contrast to its name, SMBA is not an allergic disease but a hematologic disease, as mosquito saliva can trigger EBV reactivation and EBV-oncogene expression in latently infected NK cells [4, 5]. Life-threatening complications, such as NK/T-cell lymphoma or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), could be the most important effects throughout the extended clinical course of SMBA [6, 7]. We report the first Korean case of EBV-positive NK/T-cell lymphoma that progressed from SMBA, with coexistence of HLH. Two similar cases had been reported in Korea [2, 3]. One of these showed similar symptoms such as NK cell lymphocytosis and hemophagocytic syndrome, but it did not progress to lymphoma [2]. The other case showed similar history as our patient, and the condition progressed to lymphoma; however, it was related to neither bone marrow (BM) involvement nor HLH [3]. This case report was written in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision) and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. A 17-year-old boy had experienced waxing and waning edematous skin lesions whenever bitten by mosquitoes since 11 years of age, and those skin lesions had never been treated. As his symptoms were worsening, he visited a local dermatologist for his right upper arm mass lesion with necrosis in January 2018, and a skin excision was performed. However, the skin necrosis worsened. In February 2018, a skin biopsy of the right upper arm lesion was performed at Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea, which revealed NK/T-cell lymphoma with a background of Tand NK-cell type chronic active EBV in-',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Arthropod-borne viruses present important public health challenges worldwide. Viruses such as DENV, ZIKV, and WNV are of current concern due to an increasing incidence and an expanding geographic range, generating explosive outbreaks even in non-endemic areas. The clinical signs associated with infection from these arboviruses are often inapparent, mild, or nonspecific, but occasionally develop into serious complications marked by rapid onset, tremors, paralysis, hemorrhagic fever, neurological alterations, or death. They are predominately transmitted to humans through mosquito bite, during which saliva is inoculated into the skin to facilitate blood feeding. A new approach to prevent arboviral diseases has been proposed by the observation that arthropod saliva facilitates transmission of pathogens. Viruses released within mosquito saliva may more easily initiate host invasion by taking advantage of the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses to saliva. This provides a rationale for creating vaccines against mosquito salivary proteins, especially because of the lack of licensed vaccines against most of these viruses. This review aims to provide an overview of the effects on the host immune response by the mosquito salivary proteins and how these phenomena alter the infection outcome for different arboviruses, recent attempts to generate mosquito salivary-based vaccines against flavivirus including DENV, ZIKV, and WNV, and the potential benefits and pitfalls that this strategy involves.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Zika is a mosquito-borne viral disease, causing acute debilitating symptoms and complications in infected individuals and irreversible neuronal abnormalities in newborn children. The primary vectors of ZIKV are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. ABSTRACT The primary route of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission is through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, when it probes the skin of a vertebrate host during a blood meal. Viral particles are injected into the bite site together with mosquito saliva and a complex mixture of other components. Some of them are known to play a key role in the augmentation of the arbovirus infection in the host, with increased viremia and/or morbidity. This vector-derived contribution to the infection is not usually considered when vaccine candidates are tested in preclinical animal models. In this study, we performed a preclinical validation of a promising ZIKV vaccine candidate in a mosquito-mouse transmission model using both Asian and African ZIKV lineages. Mice were immunized with engineered ZIKV virus-like particles and subsequently infected through the bite of ZIKV-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Despite a mild increase in viremia in mosquito-infected mice compared to those infected through traditional needle injection, the vaccine protected the animals from developing the disease and strongly reduced viremia. In addition, during peak viremia, naive mosquitoes were allowed to feed on infected vaccinated and nonvaccinated mice. Our analysis of viral titers in mosquitos showed that the vaccine was able to inhibit virus transmission from the host to the vector. IMPORTANCE Zika is a mosquito-borne viral disease, causing acute debilitating symptoms and complications in infected individuals and irreversible neuronal abnormalities in newborn children. The primary vectors of ZIKV are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Despite representing a significant public health burden with a widespread transmission in many regions of the world, Zika remains a neglected disease with no effective antiviral therapies or approved vaccines. It is known that components of the mosquito bite lead to an enhancement of viral infection and spread, but this aspect is often overlooked when vaccine candidates undergo preclinical validation. In this study, we included mosquitoes as viral vectors, demonstrating the ability of a promising vaccine candidate to protect animals against ZIKV infections after the bite of an infected mosquito and to also prevent its further transmission. These findings represent an additional crucial step for the development of an effective prevention tool for clinical use.',\n",

Most are odorous compounds and require organic solvents for dispersion. This work investigates the barrier properties of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). CNCs are known to self-assemble in strong, transparent, chemical barrier films. They are fully bio-based, and their surface chemistry is ideal for aqueous dispersion of many compounds. This work saw a significant 80% decrease in feeding on human skin when a thin CNC coat was applied. The effect was further confirmed by artificial feeding on Aedes aegypti wherein CNC appears to act as a chemical camouflage to the many cues sought by the insects. The combined effect of CNC with indole reduced egg laying post exposure to mammalian blood close to null with 99.4% less eggs as compared to control. The chemical barrier effect was assessed through a simple headspace experiment showing that the same CNC coat blocked the passage of ammonium hydroxide vapor, a commonly used mosquito attractant, when applied on a filter paper membrane.',\n",

Materials for this review, which included works published for the last decade and even earlier, were sourced from the research databases Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and JSTOR using the keywords \"essential oils,\" \"larvicidal activity,\" \"oviposition deterrent,\" \"repellents,\" \"toxicity,\" \"safety,\" and \"efficacy.\" \" Recent research has found that low and middle-income African populations prefer plant-based repellents over manufactured chemical repellents such as N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide and N, N-diethyl phenylacetamide.

       "  'abstract': 'Simple Summary The repellent efficacy of ten essential oils was measured against all three-mosquito species using the arm-in-cage approach to determine the duration of protection. All essential oils showed high complete-protection time against Culex quinquefasciatus, ranging from 120 to 360 min. Petitgrain oil showed the highest complete-protection time from bites of Aedes aegypti for 270 min. Peppermint oil also exhibited complete-protection time from bites of Anopheles dirus for 180 min. When two highly effective essential oils were combined to potentially prolong mosquito bite protection, the binary combinations of petitgrain with other essential oils (basil and coriander) exhibited antagonistic effects and provided complete protection against A. aegypti bite for 150 min. On the other hand, the sage and patchouli oil combination showed more repellent activity from A. dirus bite for 270 min than an individual oil. The binary combination efficiently increased or decreased protection time. Abstract Mosquito repellents reduce human-vector contact of vector-borne diseases. We compared the repellent activity of 10 undiluted essential oils (anise, basil, bergamot, coriander, patchouli, peppermint, petitgrain, rosemary, sage and vetiver) against A. aegypti, A. dirus and C. quinquefasciatus using the arm-in-cage method. Petitgrain oil was the most effective against A. aegypti (270 min). Peppermint oil was the most effective against A. dirus (180 min). Interestingly, all single oils had attributes of repellency against C. quinquefasciatus (ranged, 120–360 min). Moreover, we integrated their binary combinations of highly effective essential oils against A. aegypti and A. dirus to potentially increase the protection time. A 1:1 combination of petitgrain/basil, petitgrain/coriander, basil/coriander and basil/sage reduced the median complete-protection time of 150 min for A. aegypti; a combination of sage and patchouli oils prolonged the median complete-protection time of 270 min for A. dirus.

This study aimed to investigate the antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and larvicidal activities of its fruit essential oil. The essential oil sample from China (EOZC) was mainly composed of limonene (29.78%) and β-myrcene (26.65%), while the sample from Myanmar (EOZM) was dominated by Terpinen-4-ol (43.35%). Both essential oils showed antifungal activity, with 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values ranging from 26.3 to 499 μg/mL. By obviously inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) in RAW 264.7 cells, EOZC (IC50, 16 μg/mL) showed comparable anti-inflammatory activity to the positive control L-NMMA (IC50, 12.2 μg/mL). EOZM showed significant antiviral activity against the dengue virus with an IC50 value of 13 μg/mL. Additionally, both EOZC and EOZM demonstrated dose-dependent larvicidal activity against Aedes albopictus, with LC50 and LC90 values ranging from 45.8 to 144.0 μg/mL.

       "  'abstract': 'Decreasing opportunities for mosquitoes to bite is critical in the reduction of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission, such as Plasmodium spp. or dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. Field-evolved resistance to a large selection of synthetic insecticides is crippling efforts to reduce mosquito populations and new strategies are necessary to sustain the efficacy of commercially available tools. Aedes aegypti (L.), among other species, have evolved pyrethroid resistance in the field and the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico (PR) strain is a valuable tool for understanding resistance mechanisms. A previous study showed that pyrethroid efficacy can be enhanced by pre-exposing the PR strain to essential oil vapors before topical application of deltamethrin. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are current products commercialized for mosquito bite protection, but nets using pyrethroids are losing efficacy in the field due to field-evolved pyrethroid resistance. This study tested essential oils previously identified to affect pyrethroid efficacy, as well as their main isolates, to assess if they can restore the efficacy of pyrethroid-treated LLIN against the PR strain. We show that although amyris (Amyris balsamifera) expectedly decreases net efficacy, increased mortality can be obtained after exposure to tagetes (Tagetes bipinnata) and cajeput (Melaleuca cajuputi) oils, but also after exposure to their isolates, such as dihydro tagetone and ocimene, from 1 h after exposure to the net.

These mechanisms are based on the assumption that mosquito salivary components are somehow implicated in the pruritus that results after a bite. In the first mechanism, salivary components such as histamine are said to directly induce itch via classic pruritic pathways. The second mechanism involves an IgE-dependent hypersensitivity response to salivary components. Finally, in the third mechanism, salivary components modulate an IgE-independent inflammatory response. Individuals’ susceptibility to being bitten relies on factors that may be altered by genetics, as certain immune-related loci have been associated with mosquito bite trait characteristics. Furthermore, certain disease states such as hematologic cancers and HIV may exaggerate the response to mosquito bites. Several preventative measures such as mosquito repellants should be used to prevent the bite of a mosquito, and in cases where bites cannot be avoided, most treatment options serve to relieve symptoms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'By transmitting major human diseases, mosquito species represent a serious threat worldwide in terms of public health. Most vector control programmes aiming to control life-threatening mosquitoes rely on the use of chemical insecticides. For the reason that only a few insecticides are used for public health, maintaining the efficacy of control programmes mostly relies on resistance management strategies. Development of such strategies requires understanding the factors influencing resistance together with characterizing the mechanisms involved. In this context, the present study aims to update current knowledge about the effect of temperature on the mosquito Culex pipiens population response to chemical insecticides. The results demonstrated that alteration of the temperature significantly affects Cx. pipiens populations. High temperature (25, 30°C) resulted in high survival rate (90, 95% respectively); while at temperature 20°C the survival rate was 80%. Egg hatching percentage was 95% after 24 h, at temperature 30°C and 50% after 24h, 50% after 48h at 25°C; however at 20°C egg hatching percentage was 100% after 48 h. In case of Cx. pipiens larvae that were reared under various temperatures pupated on day 5, 9 and 12 at 30°C, 25°C and 20°C, respectively. At high temperature 30°C, females emerged before males. On the other hand resistance of all Cx. pipiens populations to the selected chemical insecticides decreased with raising temperature. The obtained results also showed that there was significant change in acetylcholinesterase and glutathione -S-transferase level in both larvae and adult due to temperature changing. These results indicate that temperature is an important parameter that must be considered during the application of chemical assays or control of Cx. pipiens populations.',\n",

This progressive damage to the tooth structure can lead to pain, infection, and even tooth loss if left untreated. Understanding the causes, prevention methods, and treatment options for cavities is crucial for maintaining good oral hygiene and overall health. \\n\\n**Key Facts:**\\n\\n* **Prevalence:** Cavities are one of the most prevalent chronic diseases globally.\\n    * The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 3.5 billion people suffer from oral diseases, with cavities being a major contributor ([Source: WHO Oral Health Data]).\\n    * In the United States, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research reports that over 90% of adults have had at least one cavity in their lifetime ([Source: NIDCR]). \\n* **Demographics:** Cavities can affect individuals of all ages, but certain groups are more susceptible:\\n    * Children and teenagers\\n    * Older adults \\n    * Individuals with dry mouth\\n    * People with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes \\n\\n**Symptoms:** \\n\\nEarly-stage cavities may not exhibit noticeable symptoms. However, as the decay progresses, common signs include:\\n\\n* Toothache or sensitivity \\n* Pain when biting down\\n* Visible holes or pits in the teeth\\n* Brown or black staining on the tooth surface\\n* Bad breath or an unpleasant taste in the mouth\\n\\n**Types:**\\n\\n* **Coronal Cavities:**  The most common type, affecting the chewing surfaces of the teeth. \\n* **Root Cavities:** Develop on the tooth root surface, often in older adults as gums recede.\\n* **Pit and Fissure Cavities:** Occur in the grooves and crevices of the teeth, typically on molars and premolars. \\n\\n**Causes:**\\n\\nCavities develop from a complex interaction of factors, primarily:\\n\\n* **Bacteria:** Certain bacteria in the mouth thrive on sugars and starches from food and drinks, producing acids that attack tooth enamel. \\n* **Plaque Formation:** A sticky film that forms on teeth, harboring bacteria and acids. \\n* **Frequent Snacking and Sugary Drinks:**  Provide a constant food source for bacteria to produce enamel-damaging acids.\\n* **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Inadequate brushing and flossing allow plaque and bacteria to accumulate.\\n\\n**Risk Factors:**\\n\\nSeveral factors increase the risk of developing cavities:\\n\\n* **Diet High in Sugary Foods and Drinks:** \\n* **Frequent Snacking:** \\n* **Inadequate Fluoride Exposure:** \\n* **Dry Mouth:**  \\n* **Eating Disorders:**  \\n* **Genetics:** \\n\\n**Diagnosis:**\\n\\nDentists diagnose cavities through:\\n\\n* **Oral Examination:** Visual inspection for signs of decay.\\n* **Dental X-rays:** Reveal cavities in early stages or between teeth.\\n* **Probing:** Gently examining teeth with a dental instrument to check for soft areas. \\n\\n**Prevention:**\\n\\n* **Brushing Twice Daily with Fluoride Toothpaste:** Fluoride helps make the outer layer of teeth, called enamel, stronger. It can rebuild weak spots in the enamel, reversing signs of decay. ([Source: Patient education: Fluoride (The Basics)])\\n* **Daily Flossing:** \\n* **Limiting Sugary Foods and Drinks:** \\n* **Regular Dental Check-ups and Cleanings:**\\n* **Dental Sealants:** Protective coatings applied to chewing surfaces of teeth.\\n* **Fluoride Treatments:** Strengthen tooth enamel and make it more resistant to acid attacks. \\n\\n**Specialist to Visit:**\\n\\n* **Dentist:** Primary healthcare professional for oral health. \\n* **Dental Hygienist:**  Provides professional cleaning and preventative care.\\n\\n**Treatment:**\\n\\nThe treatment for cavities depends on the extent of the decay:\\n\\n* **Fillings:**  Removing decayed tooth material and filling the cavity with materials like composite resin or amalgam.\\n* **Crowns:**  Caps placed over damaged teeth to restore shape and function.\\n* **Root Canal Treatment:**  Necessary when decay reaches the tooth\\'s inner pulp; involves removing infected pulp and sealing the tooth.\\n* **Extraction:** Removal of severely damaged teeth that cannot be restored.\\n\\n**Home-Care:**\\n\\n* **Maintain Excellent Oral Hygiene:** Continue brushing and flossing as instructed by your dentist.\\n* **Use Fluoride Mouthwash:** \\n* **Healthy Diet:** Reduce sugary foods and drinks.\\n* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to stimulate saliva production.\\n\\n**Living With:**\\n\\n* **Regular Dental Visits:** Schedule checkups and cleanings as recommended by your dentist.\\n* **Early Intervention:** Promptly address any new tooth sensitivity or pain.\\n* **Healthy Lifestyle Choices:** \\n\\n**Complications:**\\n\\nUntreated cavities can lead to:\\n\\n* **Severe Toothache and Infection:**  \\n* **Abscess Formation:** A painful pocket of pus at the tooth root.\\n* **Tooth Loss:** \\n* **Chewing Difficulties:** \\n* **Speech Problems:** \\n* **Loss of Confidence:**  \\n* **Systemic Infections:** In rare cases, infections can spread to other body parts.\\n\\n**Alternative Therapies:**\\n\\n* **Oil Pulling:**  \\n* **Xylitol:** A natural sugar alcohol that may inhibit the growth of cavity-causing bacteria.\\n* **Herbal Remedies:** Some herbs, such as clove oil, have antimicrobial properties that may provide temporary relief from toothache pain. However, these are not substitutes for professional dental care.\\n\\n**FAQs:** \\n\\n**Q: Can cavities heal on their own?**\\n\\n**A:** No, cavities cannot heal independently. Once the enamel is damaged, it cannot regenerate. \\n\\n**Q: Are cavities contagious?** \\n\\n**A:** While cavities themselves are not contagious, the bacteria that contribute to their development can be transmitted through saliva.\\n\\n**Q: Can babies get cavities?**\\n\\n**A:** Yes, even infants can develop cavities, often referred to as \"baby bottle tooth decay.\"\\n\\n**References:**\\n\\n* [Source: WHO Oral Health Data]\\n* [Source: NIDCR] \\n* [Patient education: Fluoride (The Basics)]([https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoride-the-basics](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoride-the-basics): [https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoride-the-basics](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoride-the-basics))\\n\\n\\n    REFERENCES:\\n    [\\n  {\\n    \"section\": \"Overview\",\\n    \"title\": \"An International Research Agenda for Oral Health Birth Cohort Studies.\",\\n    \"abstract\": \"The GLOBICS-Global Consortium of Oral Health Birth Cohort Studies (OHBCS)-is a long-lasting international collaborative research group among existing OHBCS, established in response to the Lancet Series on Oral Health, which pointed out the need to shift the global oral health agenda.

Sugar intake triggers the brain\\'s dopamine system, creating a sense of reward that unconsciously conditions a preference for foods that satisfy cravings. Over time, this weakens attraction to healthier, low-fat and low-sugar foods. This response shares characteristics with addiction, sparking the concept of \\\\\"food addiction.\\\\\" For early humans, this reward-driven behaviour was advantageous, motivating them to seek high-calorie foods essential for survival when food was scarce. Today, however, it fuels a global surge in obesity and diabetes the real \\\\\"killer\\\\\" of our times. Additionally, a study on fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) found that a sugar-heavy diet reduces sensitivity to sweetness, leading to increased consumption. This phenomenon, like \\\\\"desensitisation\\\\\" in humans, suggests that high sugar intake may promote obesity by altering taste perception and reward circuits [May et al., 2019]. The link between sugar-rich diets, obesity, and public health is a critical concern for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the sustainability of the western healthcare system. A 2024 study published in BMJ [Lara-Castor et al., 2024] revealed that from 1990 to 2018, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in children and adolescents (aged 3-19) from 185 countries rose by 23%, paralleling a global rise in obesity rates in this age group (Fig. 1). The findings highlighted a range of consumption levels influenced by factors like age, parental education, and urban living; however, the overall increase calls for national and targeted approaches to reduce SSB intake. Exactly like the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) among children and adolescents aged 5-19 has risen dramatically from just 8% in 1990 to 20% in 2022. While just 2% of children and adolescents aged 5-19 was obese in 1990 (31 million young people), by 2022, 8% of children and adolescents were living with obesity (160 million young people) [GBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators 2020; Okunogbe et al., 2022] (Fig. 2) [Ritchie and Roser, 2017]. Establishing good habits early is vital, as children are highly receptive to new behaviours. Notably, paediatric prevention begins even in the womb [Paglia 2017; Paglia, 2019]: a 2021 Canadian study [Laforest-Lapointeet al, 2021] linked maternal consumption of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy to an increased risk of infant obesity. By examining the gut microbiomes of 100 infants, researchers found that artificial sweetener intake could influence infant gut health and body mass index in the first year of life. The effects of sugar thus begin before birth and extend into early childhood. In Italy, added sugars are often introduced into infants\\' diets before 12 months, and delayed oral hygiene practices worsen the risks. Parental obesity further correlates with a higher incidence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC), emphasizing the need to address sugar consumption and health habits from prenatal to early childhood stages [D\\'oria, Bettocchi et al., 2024] Addressing the roots of obesity and diet-related diseases in young populations is therefore crucial and early intervention is key. In Italy, the government is attempting to curb sugar consumption through the so-called \\\\\"sugar tax,\\\\\" introduced in the 2020 Budget Law. The tax was initially set to take effect on January 1st, 2021; but was postponed to January 1st, 2022. Then to January 1st, 2023; again to January 1st, 2024, and recently postponed once more to January 1st, 2025\\\\u2026Hoping next year will finally be the one!\",\\n    \"citation\": \"Colombo S, Paglia L. \\\\\"Childhood obesity, sugar, and Early Childhood Caries: the sweet trap.\\\\\" (2024).

Background AD\\\\u00a0is a progressive neurological condition marked by disrupted cholinergic signaling, accumulation of A\\\\u03b2 peptide, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Currently, no direct anti-Alzheimer drug that effectively prevents the cognitive decline from AD has been reported. To combat this, a multi-target drug addressing several molecular aspects would be ideal for AD. Natural compounds are preferred over synthetic drugs due to their accessibility, cost-efficiency, and lower toxicity The proven association between polyphenol\\\\u00a0consumption and the prevention of AD has led to the investigation of the effect of FA, a polyphenolic compound, on acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity and A\\\\u03b2 peptide formation, the key targets of AD. Materials and method The free radical scavenging ability of FA was assessed by xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, FA was also evaluated for its inhibitory activity against AChE enzyme and amyloid beta peptide formation to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of FA. Results The results showed that FA has the potential to be an AChE inhibitor, thus helping in blocking the activity of AChE and also reducing the incidence of amyloid beta plaque formation. Furthermore, the compound also exhibited a significant antioxidant property which was demonstrated by the xanthine oxidase enzyme inhibitory effect. Conclusion From the observed results, FA has significant antioxidant and neuroprotective effects which are compared with those of their respective standards. More research is required to determine the efficacy and safety of this compound as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases like AD because the precise mechanism and degree of its AChE inhibitory effects in the brain are still elusive.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to fill these knowledge gaps. We compared racially minoritized (E) children aged 5\\\\u201311 years (P) with same-age privileged groups (C) to determine the magnitude and correlates of racial inequities in dental caries (O) in observational studies (S). Using the PICOS selection criteria, a targeted search was performed from inception to December 1, 2021, in nine major electronic databases and an online web search for additional grey literature. The primary outcome measures were caries severity, as assessed by mean decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft) among children and untreated dental caries prevalence (d > 0%). The meta-analysis used the random-effects model to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Subgroup analysis, tests for heterogeneity (I2, Galbraith plot), leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, cumulative analysis, and publication bias (Egger\\\\u2019s test and funnel plots) tests were carried out. The New Castle Ottawa scale was used to assess risk of bias. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021282771. A total of 75 publications were included in the descriptive analysis. The SMD of dmft score was higher by 2.30 (95% CI: 0.45, 4.15), and the prevalence of untreated dental caries was 23% (95% CI: 16, 31) higher among racially minoritized children, compared to privileged groups. Cumulative analysis showed worsening caries outcomes for racially marginalized children over time and larger inequities in dmft among high-income countries. Our study highlights the high caries burden among minoritized children globally by estimating overall trends and comparing against factors including time, country, and world income. The large magnitude of these inequities, combined with empirical evidence on the oral health impacts of racism and other forms of oppression, reinforce that oral health equity can only be achieved with social and political changes at a global level.\",\\n    \"citation\": \"Sonia Nath, S.

Both diseases can lead to nutritional compromise and negative impacts upon self-esteem and quality of life. As complex chronic diseases, they share common risk factors, such as a requirement for a pathogenic plaque biofilm, yet they exhibit distinct pathophysiologies. Multiple exposures contribute to their causal pathways, and susceptibility involves risk factors that are inherited (e.g. genetic variants), and those that are acquired (e.g. socio-economic factors, biofilm load or composition, smoking, carbohydrate intake). Identification of these factors is crucial in the prevention of both diseases as well as in their management.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAIM\\\\nTo systematically appraise the scientific literature to identify potential risk factors for caries and periodontal diseases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMETHODS\\\\nOne systematic review (genetic risk factors), one narrative review (role of diet and nutrition) and reference documentation for modifiable acquired risk factors common to both disease groups, formed the basis of the report.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRESULTS & CONCLUSIONS\\\\nThere is moderately strong evidence for a genetic contribution to periodontal diseases and caries susceptibility, with an attributable risk estimated to be up to 50%. The genetics literature for periodontal disease is more substantial than for caries and genes associated with chronic periodontitis are the vitamin D receptor (VDR), Fc gamma receptor IIA (Fc-\\\\u03b3RIIA) and Interleukin 10 (IL10) genes. For caries, genes involved in enamel formation (AMELX, AMBN, ENAM, TUFT, MMP20, and KLK4), salivary characteristics (AQP5), immune regulation and dietary preferences had the largest impact. No common genetic variants were found. Fermentable carbohydrates (sugars and starches) were the most relevant common dietary risk factor for both diseases, but associated mechanisms differed. In caries, the fermentation process leads to acid production and the generation of biofilm components such as Glucans. In periodontitis, glycaemia drives oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products may also trigger a hyper inflammatory state. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as for vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin B12, may be related to the onset and progression of both diseases. Functional foods or probiotics could be helpful in caries prevention and periodontal disease management, although evidence is limited and biological mechanisms not fully elucidated. Hyposalivation, rheumatoid arthritis, smoking/tobacco use, undiagnosed or sub-optimally controlled diabetes and obesity are common acquired risk factors for both caries and periodontal diseases.\",\\n    \"citation\": \"I.

Like coronal caries, root caries can be associated with pain, discomfort, tooth loss, and contribute significantly to poorer oral health-related quality of life in the elderly. Supplementing the visual-tactile examination could prove beneficial in improving the accuracy of early detection and diagnosis. The detection of root caries lesions at an early stage in the disease continuum can inform diagnosis and lead to targeted preventive therapies and lesion arrest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOBJECTIVES\\\\nTo assess the diagnostic test accuracy of index tests for the detection and diagnosis of root caries in adults, used alone or in combination with other tests.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSEARCH METHODS\\\\nCochrane Oral Health\\'s Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2018); Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2018); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 31 December 2018); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 31 December 2018). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSELECTION CRITERIA\\\\nWe included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared one or more index tests (laser fluorescence, radiographs, visual examination, electronic caries monitor (ECM), transillumination), either independently or in combination, with a reference standard. This included prospective studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. In vitro and in vivo studies were eligible for inclusion but studies that artificially created carious lesions were excluded.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\\\\nTwo review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) specific to the review context. Estimates of diagnostic test accuracy were expressed as sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each dataset. We planned to use hierarchical models for data synthesis and explore potential sources of heterogeneity through meta-regression.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMAIN RESULTS\\\\nFour cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies providing eight datasets with data from 4997 root surfaces were analysed. Two in vitro studies evaluated secondary root caries lesions on extracted teeth and two in vivo studies evaluated primary root caries lesions within the oral cavity. Four studies evaluated laser fluorescence and reported estimates of sensitivity ranging from 0.50 to 0.81 and specificity ranging from 0.40 to 0.80. Two studies evaluated radiographs and reported estimates of sensitivity ranging from 0.40 to 0.63 and specificity ranging from 0.31 to 0.80. One study evaluated visual examination and reported sensitivity of 0.75 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.93) and specificity of 0.38 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.68). One study evaluated the accuracy of radiograph and visual examination in combination and reported sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.96) and specificity of 0.54 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.81). Given the small number of studies and important differences in the clinical and methodological characteristics of the studies we were unable to pool the results. Consequently, we were unable to formally evaluate the comparative accuracy of the different tests considered in this review. Using QUADAS-2 we judged all four studies to be at overall high risk of bias, but only two to have applicability concerns (patient selection domain). Reasons included bias in the selection process, use of post hoc (data driven) positivity thresholds, use of an imperfect reference standard, and use of extracted teeth. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to study limitations and serious imprecision of the results (downgraded two levels), and judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAUTHORS\\' CONCLUSIONS\\\\nVisual-tactile examination is the mainstay of root caries detection and diagnosis; however, due to the paucity of the evidence base and the very low certainty of the evidence we were unable to determine the additional benefit of adjunctive diagnostic tests for the detection and diagnosis of root caries.\",\\n    \"citation\": \"P.

This work aims to describe the pathophysiological process of gingivitis and discuss the mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory drugs. Methodology: This work is a literature review carried out on Google Scholar, PUBMED and SciELO platforms. Results and Discussion: Bacteria accumulated in the plaque are recognized by phagocytes, which are activated and induce immune and inflammatory responses, in addition to activating oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, resulting in bacterial death and gingival necrosis. In the face of aggression, gingiva cells activate the arachidonic acid cascade, which gives rise to several pro-inflammatory mediators; Typical anti-inflammatory drugs block enzymes in this cascade, inhibiting the production of these chemical signals. Conclusion: Therefore, immune and inflammatory responses are important for the prognosis of gingivitis, however, in some cases, therapeutic interventions are necessary so that there is no great tissue and tooth loss.\",\\n    \"citation\": \". \\\\\"Mechanisms of the immune/inflammatory responses and production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in gingivitis and pharmacodynamics of anti-inflammatory drugs\\\\\" (2022).

Today, the study of molecular genetic predictors of disease, including dental caries, has become widespread. We searched for literature sources in domestic and foreign scientometric databases in order to study the current state of the molecular genetic mechanisms of dental caries. Studies of the inheritance of dental caries in children using the twin method have clearly shown the key role of genetic markers in the development of the disease. Predisposition or resistance to caries may be the result of one or more genotypes, phenotypes and environmental influences. Tooth enamel is one of the most mineralized tissues in vertebrates, which is characterized by high strength and high compactness. Enamel formation is the result of a series of ectomesenchymal interactions. Enamel defects occur as a result of disturbances in the formation of teeth and can lead to changes in the formation of enamel or calcification of the organic matrix. Particular attention should be paid to enamel defects that occur as a result of disorders in the formation of teeth and can lead to changes in the formation of enamel or calcification of the organic matrix. Insufficiently mineralized or irregular enamel structure can lead to caries. Differential genetic factors on different anatomical structures of teeth, different surfaces of deciduous and permanent teeth also contribute to the development of carious lesions. In addition to defective mineralization, genotypic variations also make enamel more vulnerable. Numerous studies have established the role of inheritance of dental caries and identified the main genes that ensure the resistance of enamel to cariogenic factors, the completeness of the composition of saliva and the rate of salivation.\\\\n\\\\nKeywords: caries, molecular genetic determinants, amelogenesis genes, dentinogenesis genes.\",\\n    \"citation\": \"O.

However, SDF also has proven efficacy in prevention, ie, decreasing the incidence of new caries lesions. Analysis of nine clinical trials in children shows that SDF prevented 61% of new lesions compared to controls. To prevent one new caries lesion, clinicians need to treat four primary teeth (one patient) or 12.1 permanent molars (three patients) with SDF. The preventive effect appears to be immediate and maintains at the same fraction over time. Direct comparisons of SDF applied once per year with alternative treatments show that SDF is more effective than other topical fluorides placed two to four times per year and more cost-effective than dental sealants. Enamel lesions may be even more responsive than cavitated dentin lesions. Annual application of SDF to high-risk surfaces (eg, mesial surfaces of permanent first molars where the distal surface of the second primary molar is carious) in patients with any risk of new caries lesions appears to be the most cost-effective approach available to prevent dental caries.

Background: Cyclic neutropenia is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by neutropenia that recurs every 14\\\\u201335 days. It is estimated that the incidence of cyclic neutropenia is one to two per million. Clinically, it manifested by repetitive episodes of fever, susceptibility to infection, pharyngitis, recurrent mouth ulcerations, and periodontal diseases. Medical management includes supportive treatment, antibiotic therapy for infectious diseases, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), to raise blood neutrophils. Dental management of cyclic neutropenia patients varies from thorough oral hygiene, regular dental follow-ups, and surgical or nonsurgical periodontal treatment. Case description: Seven-year-old fraternal twin girls diagnosed with cyclic neutropenia at the age of 6 months. They were referred from their pediatric hematologist after complaining of recurrent aphthous ulcer and extensive dental caries.

However, the mechanism of action of xylitol on mutans streptococci is still unclear. This study evaluated the ultrastructural cellular changes in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus after xylitol treatment. Materials and methods: S. mutans ATCC 25175 and S. sobrinus ATCC 33478 were grown separately in BHI medium plus 0.2% sucrose at 37oC under microaerophilic conditions overnight. Then, planktonic cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a fresh medium and incubated with either 0.2% glucose or 0.2% xylitol solutions for 2 hours. To prepare bacterial cells for the evaluation of morphology of cellular walls and polysaccharide capsules, cultures were subsequently fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, stained with ruthenium red, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in acetone, embedded in Epon LX112 and analyzed by a transmission electron microscopy. Results: Bacterial cells incubated with glucose showed welldefined cellular walls and well-stained cytoplasmic membrane. Unlike, xylitol yielded diffuse cellular wall and irregular polysaccharide capsules in both microorganisms. Conclusion: Low xylitol concentrations also can induce cellular damage to both S. mutans and S. sobrinus.

They also investigated xylitol\\'s mechanism of action.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMETHODS\\\\nThe authors compared cariogenic bacteria levels before and after exposure to xylitol products in children and adults. In the first study, 187 children received xylitol-containing snacks in school for four weeks. In the second study, two adults received xylitol candy for four weeks. Unstimulated saliva samples were taken from all subjects. Gingival samples also were taken from the adults. The authors plated the samples on selective microbiological media. Individual isolates were plated on media with varying concentrations of xylitol, and were identified using specific DNA probes. Genetic relatedness was determined via pulse-field gel electrophoresis.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRESULTS\\\\nThe children\\'s salivary S. mutans levels remained stable before and after xylitol exposure. Further analysis of the S. mutans isolates was conducted for seven children. Bacteria from five of these children grew with 10 percent or less xylitol at baseline, while the bacteria from all seven children grew with 15 percent xylitol after exposure to the xylitol-containing snacks, suggesting that the S. mutans increased in tolerance to xylitol during exposure. Six children had isolates with the same genotype at both time points. S. mutans and S. sobrinus levels were reduced in one of the adults as a result of xylitol exposure, and the bacterial isolates became more xylitol tolerant. In the second adult, S. mutans and S. sobrinus levels increased, while the subject maintained the same proportion of susceptible and tolerant strains as that at baseline.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCONCLUSIONS\\\\nOverall, consumption of xylitol-containing snacks and candy did not reduce S. mutans levels.

At baseline, caries status, plaque index, Streptococcus mutans count, and Lactobacillus count were evaluated. The risk assessment for caries was evaluated using a cariogram. Children were recalled after 12 months for evaluation. All children returned for the recall and data was recorded at the recall visit. Children were grouped into caries-free or caries recurrent based on the absence or presence of caries. Chi-square tests and student\\'s t-test were used for statistical analysis using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS), version 23.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRESULTS\\\\nAll 100 children returned for follow-up. 76% of the children developed new carious lesions in a period of 1 year. A statistically significant association between caries recurrence and S. mutans count and caries risk assessment (CRA) score was found (p < 0.001). No significant associations were seen between parental education levels and the oral health practices of the child.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCONCLUSION\\\\nChildren treated under full-mouth rehabilitation for ECC under general anesthesia are at risk for developing new carious lesions after treatment. New carious lesions are strongly correlated with the presence of S. mutans, and high cariographic risk scores serve as an indication of future caries. Early childhood caries may be avoided if children are more diligent in practicing good dental hygiene.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE\\\\nRelapse of caries after full-mouth rehabilitation under general anesthesia can affect the quality of life of children. Preventive measures should be initiated and reinforced to prevent the occurrence of new carious lesions after full-mouth rehabilitation.

Methods: This was a longitudinal observational study of 872 children 18 to 23 months of age in Hokkaido, Japan, with follow-up at age three years. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by parents or guardians of the children. The baseline survey contents included sex, age, the existence of smokers in the home, maternal smoking during pregnancy, nocturnal breastfeeding, snacking habits, bottle-feeding, frequency of parents brushing their child\\'s teeth, the use of fluoride toothpaste, parents sharing of utensils with child, and socio-economic status. The number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth (dmft) was obtained from dental examinations in both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds ratio for the new onset of ECC in threeyear-olds. Results: The dmft at 18 to 23 months old, nocturnal breastfeeding, prolonged breastfeeding, snacking habits, parents brushing their child\\'s teeth less frequently, and parental sharing utensils with the child were significantly associated with the incidence of ECC at age three years. Conclusions: The existence of early childhood caries in 18- to 23-month-olds may be a strong predictor of the new development of dental caries.
