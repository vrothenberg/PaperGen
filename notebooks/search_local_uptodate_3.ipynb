In SCIT, a mixture of the allergens to which you are allergic is prepared, and injections of the extract are gradually increased (over 16 to 20 weeks) as tolerated to a maintenance regimen that is then administered at your physician's office every two to four weeks over three to five years. In contrast to SLIT-tablets, another form of allergen immunotherapy is that of sublingual drops (SLIT-drops). This method involves putting drops of a solution containing a mixture of allergens under the tongue. This approach is used in various parts of the world. However, it is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in the United States, although it can be given \"off label\" (meaning that a physician can prescribe it for a condition for which it has not been officially approved). Most studies have shown that it is less effective than injection immunotherapy or SLIT tablets.\n",

Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is the best studied form of AIT and is effective for allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic asthma, and Hymenoptera venom allergy. SCIT involves the repeated subcutaneous injection of increasing amounts of allergen beginning with very small doses of allergen and gradually increasing to higher doses. Another popular method of AIT involves sublingual administration in the form of dissolvable tablets or extracts. This topic will discuss the known immunologic changes that occur during AIT. Other topics related to AIT are found separately:\n",

Many people are able to achieve long-lasting control of their symptoms with a course of treatment (usually four to five years).

Immunotherapy generally results in an increase in allergen-specific IgG antibodies, which lags behind the rise in IgE antibodies by weeks to a few months. Levels may continue to rise over many months of maintenance immunotherapy, and elevated levels may persist for many years after immunotherapy is discontinued [14].\n",
      "Studies demonstrate that high levels of allergen-specific IgG as a result of SCIT correlate with the dose of allergen that has been administered but not necessarily with clinical relief of symptoms [16]. However, the failure to produce allergen-specific IgG in an individual patient receiving immunotherapy does correlate with a lack of clinical response [5].\n",
      "Although practices differ around the world, in North America, allergen-specific IgG is used mostly as a research tool and is not routinely measured by most clinicians in the clinical practice setting, based on practice guidelines. In contrast, the author measures allergen-specific IgG prior to administration of AIT in patients who have undergone AIT in the past and finds this information can be used clinically to assess the efficacy of a patient's previous immunotherapy. For example, if the patient reports that a previous course of immunotherapy did not seem to help, the finding of low allergen-specific IgG levels to the allergen given essentially confirms that the therapy was not effective.\n",

      "Patients on chronic beta-blocker treatment for cardiovascular disease are at some risk for a poor outcome if they have an anaphylactic reaction to an immunotherapy injection, since they may not respond properly to epinephrine or other vasopressor agents used to treat the reaction. Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are theoretically at increased risk during anaphylaxis, possibly due to the inhibition of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in poorer response to hemodynamic stress during hypotension or to accumulated bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. The data behind these conclusions are presented elsewhere. (See \"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy\", section on 'Beta-adrenergic blockers' and \"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy\", section on 'ACE inhibitors'.)\n",
      "As with any therapeutic decision, the risk must be weighed against the benefit [8]. Most clinicians avoid administering SCIT to patients on significant doses of beta-blockers. In some cases, hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders can be treated with medications that do not carry these risks. A European guideline considers beta-blocker use to be relatively contraindicated in aeroallergen SCIT, although not with venom immunotherapy in patients with clear indications for both interventions, since venom immunotherapy is considered potentially lifesaving [77]. Unlike immunotherapy for venom allergy, immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis or asthma is generally considered elective. The use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in patients receiving venom immunotherapy is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

In this study, self-reported food allergy cases were deemed convincing if symptoms matched those of IgE-mediated reactions.\\nTheories about why food allergy may be increasing in adults includes aging of the generation of children in which food allergy incidence increased or the presence of factors that are predisposing both children and adults to the development of food allergy.

This is generally done before any testing takes place to determine the pretest probability that will inform interpretation of the results. Testing for IgE-mediated food allergies can be performed with skin testing or in vitro immunoassays for IgE specific to the food in question. Skin testing is the preferred method of diagnosing food allergy in most cases because it is usually more sensitive and the negative predictive value is high. Skin testing should be performed by allergy specialists. If skin testing or in vitro testing is inconclusive, a graded challenge may be performed. (See \"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy\", section on \\'Prick/puncture skin tests\\' and \"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy\", section on \\'Food challenges\\'.)\\nFor patients with IgE-mediated allergy, allergists can also provide advice about effective avoidance and ongoing education about anaphylaxis and use of self-administered epinephrine, which requires time and can be challenging to do in a busy primary care setting.

Specific patterns of microbiota colonization, such as colonization in large number by probiotics or greater microbial diversity, may favor tolerance, possibly through increased production of IgA and IL-10 [146-152]. Similarly, skin commensal bacteria have been recognized as significant factors imprinting the immune system [153], possibly also influencing food allergy.\\nCesarean delivery is postulated to increase the risk of IgE-mediated sensitization to food allergens as a result of alterations in the gut microbiota [154,155]. Data on the impact of cesarean delivery on the rate of clinical food allergy are inconsistent, although most studies show an increased risk [154,156-159]. One study showed that treatment with probiotics during the last month of pregnancy and first six months of infancy may decrease IgE-associated allergic disease, particularly eczema, and sensitization to food allergens in children at high risk for atopic disease born by cesarean delivery [160]. However, another study found that only emergency cesarean section, not planned cesarean section with less exposure to maternal vaginal and fecal microflora, was associated with an increased risk of food allergy, suggesting that other factors not associated with early-life microbial transfer are playing a role [161].\\nChildren with food allergy have a dysbiotic gut microbiota that fails to protect against the development of food allergy when transferred to mice. Therapy with a consortium of protective clostridial species suppresses food allergy in mice [162], suggesting that gut microbiota dysbiosis is a potential target for future treatment of food allergy if these findings are replicated in humans.\\nIn a mouse model of induced food allergy by skin sensitization, feeding mice a high-fat diet prior to skin sensitization and subsequent gastrointestinal challenge to a food allergen was associated with development of obesity, decreased intestinal bacterial diversity, and increased food allergy susceptibility [163]. Transfer of the gut microbiome from these mice to germ-free recipient mice on a normal diet led to decreased intestinal bacterial diversity and increased food allergy susceptibility but not obesity.

Food allergies are broadly categorized into either IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated processes (eg, food protein-induced enterocolitis, cell-mediated contact dermatitis to foods) [14].

The impact of this disorder is felt in daycare, preschool, school, and camp settings, environments that are integral to a child\\'s life [5,6].\\nThe most common food allergies in childhood are cow\\'s milk, hen\\'s eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, and soy [1,7]. Peanut allergy is of particular concern in the United States because it is implicated in fatal reactions more than any other food [8-10]. However, many foods can cause life-threatening allergic reactions [9,10]. It is crucial for medical professionals to understand the challenge that this disorder presents [11]. The avoidance strategies in place to keep a food-allergic child safe will often impact the entire classroom of children, particularly in younger age groups.\\nThis topic presents an overview of the prevalence of food allergy in school-aged children; provides data about food-allergic reactions in schools, camps, and similar environments; and discusses strategies for managing food allergy in these settings. A similar discussion of food allergy in college or university students is presented separately. (See \"Food allergy in college and university students: Overview and management\".)\\nThe information in this topic provides an overview of the components of effective management of food allergy in schools and camps.

The definitive diagnosis of an IgE-mediated food allergy requires both sensitization and a history of consistent signs and symptoms on exposure to that food. Sensitization alone is not sufficient to diagnose food allergy, because individuals can be sensitized to a food (which is not uncommon) without having clinical symptoms upon ingestion. For example, patients with respiratory allergy to dust mite may have positive serum IgE to shrimp or other shellfish (because the testing cannot differentiate between different allergens within these two phylogenetically related organisms) but not have shrimp allergy. For this reason, searching for culprit foods with extensive panels of IgE immunoassays when the history is vague is rarely productive and can be misleading.\\nIn contrast, an immunoassay for IgE to the specific food in question can be very helpful if one or a small number of suspect foods are implicated by the history. For example, it is reasonable for the generalist to obtain an immunoassay for IgE to shrimp if a patient developed hives, pruritus, and nausea while eating shrimp cocktail. When the clinical history is highly suggestive of allergy to a specific food (high pretest probability), a positive in vitro test is often sufficient for diagnosis.\\nImmunoassays for food-specific IgE are widely available and not affected by antihistamines or other medications the patient may be taking. Higher concentrations of food-specific IgE correlate to an increased likelihood of a reaction upon ingestion, although a patient with a significant food allergy can have a high, medium, low, or even negative in vitro test. A patient can also have a low-positive level to a food that is tolerated. The use and interpretation of IgE immunoassays and skin tests to foods are reviewed in detail separately. (See \"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy\", section on \\'In vitro testing\\'.)\\nImproved forms of IgE immunoassays, called component-resolved diagnostics, are being developed for foods that commonly cause IgE-mediated allergies.

Further workup for IgE-mediated allergy is not generally indicated if no specific foods are implicated in the history and if skin tests or in vitro measurements of specific IgE to foods are negative.\\nFood is unlikely to be the problem if respiratory symptoms persist after food elimination diets are implemented.
